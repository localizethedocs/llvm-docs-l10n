msgid ""
":program:`llvm-cxxfilt` is a symbol demangler that can be used as a "
"replacement for the GNU :program:`c++filt` tool. It takes a series of symbol "
"names and prints their demangled form on the standard output stream. If a "
"name cannot be demangled, it is simply printed as is."

msgid ""
"If no names are specified on the command-line, names are read interactively "
"from the standard input stream. When reading names from standard input, each "
"input line is split on characters that are not part of valid Itanium name "
"manglings, i.e. characters that are not alphanumeric, '.', '$', or '_'. "
"Separators between names are copied to the output as is."
