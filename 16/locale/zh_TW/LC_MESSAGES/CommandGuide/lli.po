msgid ""
":program:`lli` directly executes programs in LLVM bitcode format.  It takes "
"a program in LLVM bitcode format and executes it using a just-in-time "
"compiler or an interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lli.rst:18
msgid ""
":program:`lli` is *not* an emulator. It will not execute IR of different "
"architectures and it can only interpret (or JIT-compile) for the host "
"architecture."

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lli.rst:21
msgid ""
"The JIT compiler takes the same arguments as other tools, like :program:"
"`llc`, but they don't necessarily work for the interpreter."

"for the program from standard input."
