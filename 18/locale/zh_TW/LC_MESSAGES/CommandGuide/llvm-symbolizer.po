":program:`llvm-symbolizer` reads input names and addresses from the command-"
"line and prints corresponding source code locations to standard output. It "
"can also symbolize logs containing :doc:`Symbolizer Markup </"
"SymbolizerMarkupFormat>` via :option:`--filter-markup`. Addresses may be "
"specified as numbers or symbol names."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-symbolizer.rst:19
msgid ""
"If no address is specified on the command-line, it reads the addresses from "
"standard input. If no input name is specified on the command-line, but "
"addresses are, the first address value is treated as an input name. If an "
"input value is not recognized, it reports that source information is not "
"found."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-symbolizer.rst:24
msgid ""
"Input names can be specified together with the addresses either on standard "
"input or as positional arguments on the command-line. By default, input "
"names are interpreted as object file paths. However, prefixing a name with "
"``BUILDID:`` states that it is a hex build ID rather than a path. This will "
"look up the corresponding debug binary. For consistency, prefixing a name "
"with ``FILE:`` explicitly states that it is an object file path (the "
"default)."

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-symbolizer.rst:31
msgid ""
"A positional argument or standard input value can be preceded by \"DATA\" or "
"\"CODE\" to indicate that the address should be symbolized as data or "
"executable code respectively. If neither is specified, \"CODE\" is assumed. "
"DATA is symbolized as address and symbol size rather than line number."
