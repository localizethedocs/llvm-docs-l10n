"This tutorial will guide you through the process of making a change to LLVM, "
"and contributing it back to the LLVM project. We'll be making a change to "
"Clang, but the steps for other parts of LLVM are the same. Even though the "
"change we'll be making is simple, we're going to cover steps like building "
"LLVM, running the tests, and code review. This is good practice, and you'll "
"be prepared for making larger changes."
