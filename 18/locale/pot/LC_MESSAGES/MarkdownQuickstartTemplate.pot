"This document is meant to get you writing documentation as fast as possible "
"even if you have no previous experience with Markdown. The goal is to take "
"someone in the state of \"I want to write documentation and get it added to "
"LLVM's docs\" and turn that into useful documentation mailed to llvm-commits "
"with as little nonsense as possible."

"You can find this document in `docs/MarkdownQuickstartTemplate.md`. You "
"should copy it, open the new file in your text editor, write your docs, and "
"then send the new document to llvm-commits for review."

"Focus on *content*. It is easy to fix the Markdown syntax later if "
"necessary, although Markdown tries to imitate common plain-text conventions "
"so it should be quite natural. A basic knowledge of Markdown syntax is "
"useful when writing the document, so the last ~half of this document "
"(starting with [Example Section](#example-section)) gives examples which "
"should cover 99% of use cases."

"You generally should not be writing documentation other than a \"how to\" "
