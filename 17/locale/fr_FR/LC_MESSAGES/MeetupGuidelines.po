"Before you start, it is essential to make sure that the meetup is as "
"welcoming as any other event related to LLVM. Therefore you shall follow "
"LLVM's `Code of Conduct <https://llvm.org/docs/CodeOfConduct.html>`_."

#: ../../../MeetupGuidelines.rst:12

"Other than that - your mileage may vary. Please adapt your social to what "

"We highly recommend that you join the official LLVM meetup organization. In "
"addition to covering the cost of the meetup, all LLVM meetups are advertised "
"together and easily found by potential attendees. Please contact arnaud."
"degrandmaison@llvm.org for more details."

"Beware of cultural differences: what works well in one region may not work "
"in other part of the world."

msgid ""
"Do not be alone to organize the meetup. Try to work with a couple other "
"organizers. This is more motivating as an organizer, and this makes the "
"meetup more resilient over time."

msgid ""
"Each event can have a different form such as a social event, or a hackathon/"
"workshop, or a 'mini-conference' with one or more talks. You do not have to "
"stick to one format forever."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../MeetupGuidelines.rst:30
msgid ""
"Whatever format you choose, `LLVM Weekly <http://llvmweekly.org/>`_ is an "
"excellent topic starter: go through the 3-4 recent LLVM Weekly posts and "
"prepare a list of the most interesting/notable news and discuss them with "
"the group."

"Advertise your meetup on the mailing lists (llvm-dev, cfe-dev, lldb-"
"dev, ...). Feel free to post to all of them, or at least to llvm-dev. But as "
"these mailing lists have high traffic and some LLVM developers are not very "
"active on them, you may reach more interested people using the mailing "
"feature from meetup.com."

"Try to record the talks if possible. It adds visibility to the meetup and "
"just a good idea in general. Any modern smartphone or tablet should work, "
