"LLVM sets certain default configure options to make sure our developers "
"don't break things for constrained platforms.  These settings are not "
"optimal for most desktop systems, and we hope that packagers (e.g., Redhat, "
"Debian, MacPorts, etc.) will tweak them.  This document lists settings we "
"suggest you tweak."

"LLVM runs much more quickly when it's optimized and assertions are removed. "
"However, such a build is currently incompatible with users who build without "
"defining ``NDEBUG``, and the lack of assertions makes it hard to debug "
"problems in user code.  We recommend allowing users to install both "
"optimized and debug versions of LLVM in parallel.  The following configure "
"flags are relevant:"

"Builds LLVM with ``NDEBUG`` defined.  Changes the LLVM ABI.  Also available "
