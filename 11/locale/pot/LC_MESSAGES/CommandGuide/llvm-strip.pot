#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-strip.rst:14
msgid ""
":program:`llvm-strip` is a tool to strip sections and symbols from object "
"files. If no other stripping or remove options are specified, :option:`--"
"strip-all` will be enabled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-strip.rst:18
msgid ""
"By default, the input files are modified in-place. If \"-\" is specified for "
"the input file, the input is read from the program's standard input stream."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-strip.rst:21
msgid ""
"If the input is an archive, any requested operations will be applied to each "
"archive member individually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-strip.rst:24
msgid ""
"The tool is still in active development, but in most scenarios it works as a "
"drop-in replacement for GNU's :program:`strip`."

"The following options are either agnostic of the file format, or apply to "
"multiple file formats."

"Use real values for UIDs, GIDs and timestamps when updating archive member "
"headers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-strip.rst:40
msgid ""
"Remove most local symbols from the output. Different file formats may limit "
"this to a subset of the local symbols. For example, file and section symbols "
"in ELF objects will not be discarded."
msgstr ""

"Enable deterministic mode when stripping archives, i.e. use 0 for archive "
"member header UIDs, GIDs and timestamp fields. On by default."
