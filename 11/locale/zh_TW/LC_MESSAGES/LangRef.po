"This document is a reference manual for the LLVM assembly language. LLVM is "
"a Static Single Assignment (SSA) based representation that provides type "
"safety, low-level operations, flexibility, and the capability of "
"representing 'all' high-level languages cleanly. It is the common code "
"representation used throughout all phases of the LLVM compilation strategy."

msgid ""
"The LLVM code representation is designed to be used in three different "
"forms: as an in-memory compiler IR, as an on-disk bitcode representation "
"(suitable for fast loading by a Just-In-Time compiler), and as a human "
"readable assembly language representation. This allows LLVM to provide a "
"powerful intermediate representation for efficient compiler transformations "
"and analysis, while providing a natural means to debug and visualize the "
"transformations. The three different forms of LLVM are all equivalent. This "
"document describes the human readable representation and notation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../LangRef.rst:32
msgid ""
"The LLVM representation aims to be light-weight and low-level while being "
"expressive, typed, and extensible at the same time. It aims to be a "
"\"universal IR\" of sorts, by being at a low enough level that high-level "
"ideas may be cleanly mapped to it (similar to how microprocessors are "
"\"universal IR's\", allowing many source languages to be mapped to them). By "
"providing type information, LLVM can be used as the target of optimizations: "
"for example, through pointer analysis, it can be proven that a C automatic "
"variable is never accessed outside of the current function, allowing it to "
"be promoted to a simple SSA value instead of a memory location."

msgid ""
"It is important to note that this document describes 'well formed' LLVM "
"assembly language. There is a difference between what the parser accepts and "
"what is considered 'well formed'. For example, the following instruction is "
"syntactically okay, but not well formed:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../LangRef.rst:57
msgid ""
"because the definition of ``%x`` does not dominate all of its uses. The LLVM "
"infrastructure provides a verification pass that may be used to verify that "
"an LLVM module is well formed. This pass is automatically run by the parser "
"after parsing input assembly and by the optimizer before it outputs bitcode. "
"The violations pointed out by the verifier pass indicate bugs in "
"transformation passes or input to the parser."

msgid "Identifiers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../LangRef.rst:69
msgid ""
"LLVM identifiers come in two basic types: global and local. Global "
"identifiers (functions, global variables) begin with the ``'@'`` character. "
"Local identifiers (register names, types) begin with the ``'%'`` character. "
"Additionally, there are three different formats for identifiers, for "
"different purposes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../LangRef.rst:75
msgid ""
"Named values are represented as a string of characters with their prefix. "
"For example, ``%foo``, ``@DivisionByZero``, ``%a.really.long.identifier``. "
"The actual regular expression used is '``[%@][-a-zA-Z$._][-a-zA-Z$."
"_0-9]*``'. Identifiers that require other characters in their names can be "
"surrounded with quotes. Special characters may be escaped using ``\"\\xx\"`` "
"where ``xx`` is the ASCII code for the character in hexadecimal. In this "
"way, any character can be used in a name value, even quotes themselves. The "
"``\"\\01\"`` prefix can be used on global values to suppress mangling."
msgstr ""

msgid "Constants, which are described in the section Constants_ below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../LangRef.rst:88
msgid ""
"LLVM requires that values start with a prefix for two reasons: Compilers "
"don't need to worry about name clashes with reserved words, and the set of "
"reserved words may be expanded in the future without penalty. Additionally, "
"unnamed identifiers allow a compiler to quickly come up with a temporary "
"variable without having to avoid symbol table conflicts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../LangRef.rst:95
msgid ""
"Reserved words in LLVM are very similar to reserved words in other "
"languages. There are keywords for different opcodes ('``add``', "
"'``bitcast``', '``ret``', etc...), for primitive type names ('``void``', "
"'``i32``', etc...), and others. These reserved words cannot conflict with "
"variable names, because none of them start with a prefix character (``'%'`` "
"or ``'@'``)."
