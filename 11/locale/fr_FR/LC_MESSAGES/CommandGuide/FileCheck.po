":program:`FileCheck` reads two files (one from standard input, and one "
"specified on the command line) and uses one to verify the other.  This "
"behavior is particularly useful for the testsuite, which wants to verify "
"that the output of some tool (e.g. :program:`llc`) contains the expected "
"information (for example, a movsd from esp or whatever is interesting).  "
"This is similar to using :program:`grep`, but it is optimized for matching "
"multiple different inputs in one file in a specific order."

"FileCheck searches the contents of ``match-filename`` for patterns to "

"you'd like to use a different prefix (e.g. because the same input file is "
"checking multiple different tool or options), the :option:`--check-prefix` "
"argument allows you to specify (without the trailing \"``:``\") one or more "
