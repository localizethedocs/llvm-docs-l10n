msgid ""
"The :program:`llvm-ar` command is similar to the common Unix utility, :"
"program:`ar`. It archives several files, such as objects and LLVM bitcode "
"files into a single archive library that can be linked into a program. "
"However, the archive can contain any kind of file. By default, :program:"
"`llvm-ar` generates a symbol table that makes linking faster because only "
"the symbol table needs to be consulted, not each individual file member of "
"the archive."

"The :program:`llvm-ar` command can be used to *read* archive files in SVR4, "
"GNU, BSD and Darwin format, and *write* in the GNU, BSD, and Darwin style "
"archive files. If an SVR4 format archive is used with the :option:`r` "
"(replace), :option:`d` (delete), :option:`m` (move) or :option:`q` (quick "
"update) operations, the archive will be reconstructed in the format defined "
"by :option:`--format`."
