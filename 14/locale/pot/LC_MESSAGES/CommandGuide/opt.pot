msgid ""
"The :program:`opt` command is the modular LLVM optimizer and analyzer.  It "
"takes LLVM source files as input, runs the specified optimizations or "
"analyses on it, and then outputs the optimized file or the analysis "
"results.  The function of :program:`opt` depends on whether the `-analyze` "
"option is given."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/opt.rst:20
msgid ""
"When `-analyze` is specified, :program:`opt` performs various analyses of "
"the input source.  It will usually print the results on standard output, but "
"in a few cases, it will print output to standard error or generate a file "
"with the analysis output, which is usually done when the output is meant for "
"another program."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/opt.rst:26
msgid ""
"While `-analyze` is *not* given, :program:`opt` attempts to produce an "
"optimized output file.  The optimizations available via :program:`opt` "
"depend upon what libraries were linked into it as well as any additional "
"libraries that have been loaded with the :option:`-load` option.  Use the :"
"option:`-help` option to determine what optimizations you can use."

"If ``filename`` is omitted from the command line or is \"``-``\", :program:"
"`opt` reads its input from standard input.  Inputs can be in either the LLVM "
"assembly language format (``.ll``) or the LLVM bitcode format (``.bc``)."

"Enable binary output on terminals.  Normally, :program:`opt` will refuse to "
"write raw bitcode output if the output stream is a terminal.  With this "

":program:`opt` provides the ability to run any of LLVM's optimization or "
"analysis passes in any order.  The :option:`-help` option lists all the "
"passes available.  The order in which the options occur on the command line "
"are the order in which they are executed (within pass constraints)."

"This option causes opt to strip debug information from the module before "
"applying other optimizations.  It is essentially the same as `-strip` but it "
"ensures that stripping of debug information is done first."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/opt.rst:75
msgid ""
"This option causes opt to add a verify pass after every pass otherwise "
"specified on the command line (including `-verify`).  This is useful for "
"cases where it is suspected that a pass is creating an invalid module but it "
"is not clear which pass is doing it."

"Load the dynamic object ``plugin``.  This object should register new "
