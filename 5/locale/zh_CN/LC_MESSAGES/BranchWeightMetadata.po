"Branch Weight Metadata represents branch weights as its likeliness to be "
"taken (see :doc:`BlockFrequencyTerminology`). Metadata is assigned to the "
"``TerminatorInst`` as a ``MDNode`` of the ``MD_prof`` kind. The first "
"operator is always a ``MDString`` node with the string \"branch_weights\".  "
"Number of operators depends on the terminator type."

"To allow comparing different functions during inter-procedural analysis and "

"Currently, one counter is supported: \"function_entry_count\". The second "
"operand is a 64-bit counter that indicates the number of times that this "

"case of sampling-based profiles, this operand is an approximation of how "

"If \"function_entry_count\" has more than 2 operands, the later operands are "
"the GUID of the functions that needs to be imported by ThinLTO. This is only "
"set by sampling based profile. It is needed because the sampling based "
"profile was collected on a binary that had already imported and inlined "
"these functions, and we need to ensure the IR matches in the ThinLTO "
"backends for profile annotation. The reason why we cannot annotate this on "
"the callsite is that it can only goes down 1 level in the call chain. For "
"the cases where foo_in_a_cc()->bar_in_b_cc()->baz_in_c_cc(), we will need to "
"go down 2 levels in the call chain to import both bar_in_b_cc and "
"baz_in_c_cc."
