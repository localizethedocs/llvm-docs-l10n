"Due to Clang's influence (mostly the fact that parsing and semantic analysis "
"are so intertwined for C and especially C++), the typical working definition "
"of AST in the LLVM community is roughly \"the compiler's first complete "
"symbolic (as opposed to textual) representation of an input program\". As "
"such, an \"AST\" might be a more general graph instead of a "
"\"tree\" (consider the symbolic representation for the type of a typical "
"\"linked list node\"). This working definition is closer to what some "
"authors call an \"annotated abstract syntax tree\"."
