"This document contains the release notes for the LLVM Compiler "
"Infrastructure, release 5.0.0.  Here we describe the status of LLVM, "
"including major improvements from the previous release, improvements in "
"various subprojects of LLVM, and some of the current users of the code.  All "
"LLVM releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <http://"
"llvm.org/releases/>`_."

#: ../../../ReleaseNotes.rst:27
msgid ""
"LLVM's ``WeakVH`` has been renamed to ``WeakTrackingVH`` and a new "
"``WeakVH`` has been introduced.  The new ``WeakVH`` nulls itself out on "
"deletion, but does not track values across RAUW."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ReleaseNotes.rst:31
msgid ""
"A new library named ``BinaryFormat`` has been created which holds a "
"collection of code which previously lived in ``Support``.  This includes the "

msgid ""
"The ``BBVectorize`` pass has been removed. It was fully replaced and no "
"longer used back in 2014 but we didn't get around to removing it. Now it is "
"gone. The SLP vectorizer is the suggested non-loop vectorization pass."

"containers. Currently, it supports reverse iteration of SmallPtrSet and "
"DenseMap."
