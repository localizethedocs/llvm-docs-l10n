"First of all, please do not feel like you may be a burden to us by reporting "
"incidents. We consider reports an opportunity for us to act: by knowing "
"about an incident, we can act on it if appropriate, and reduce continuation "
"of problematic behavior.  If we don't know, we can't learn or take any "
"appropriate actions."

"If you are not sure the situation being reported was a :doc:`Code of "
"Conduct<CodeOfConduct>` violation, we encourage you to still report it. We "
"would much rather have reports where we decide to take no action, rather "
"than miss a report of an actual violation. There is no harm in reporting an "
"incident which is later determined not to be a violation, and knowing about "
"incidents that are not violations can also help us to improve the Code of "
"Conduct or the processes surrounding it."
