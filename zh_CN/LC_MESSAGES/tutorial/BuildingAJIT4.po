"Welcome to Chapter 4 of the \"Building an ORC-based JIT in LLVM\" tutorial. "
"This chapter introduces the Compile Callbacks and Indirect Stubs APIs and "
"shows how they can be used to replace the CompileOnDemand layer from "
"`Chapter 3 <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_ with a custom lazy-JITing scheme that JITs "
"directly from Kaleidoscope ASTs."
