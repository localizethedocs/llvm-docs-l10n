"Welcome to Chapter 5 of the \"Building an ORC-based JIT in LLVM\" tutorial. "
"This chapter introduces the ORC RemoteJIT Client/Server APIs and shows how "
"to use them to build a JIT stack that will execute its code via a "
"communications channel with a different process. This can be a separate "
"process on the same machine, a process on a different machine, or even a "
"process on a different platform/architecture. The code builds on top of the "
"lazy-AST-compiling JIT stack from `Chapter 4 <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_."
