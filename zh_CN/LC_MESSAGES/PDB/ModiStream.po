"The Module Info Stream (henceforth referred to as the Modi stream) contains "
"information about a single module (object file, import library, etc that "
"contributes to the binary this PDB contains debug information about.  There "
"is one modi stream for each module, and the mapping between modi stream "
"index and module is contained in the :doc:`DBI Stream <DbiStream>`.  The "
"modi stream for a single module contains line information for the compiland, "
"as well as all CodeView information for the symbols defined in the "
"compiland.  Finally, there is a \"global refs\" substream which is not well "
"understood."

"**Signature** - Unknown.  In practice only the value of ``4`` has been "
"observed.  It is hypothesized that this value corresponds to the set of "
"``CV_SIGNATURE_xx`` defines in ``cvinfo.h``, with the value of ``4`` meaning "
"that this module has C13 line information (as opposed to C11 line "
"information).  A corollary of this is that we expect to only ever see C13 "
"line info, and that we do not understand the format of C11 line info."
