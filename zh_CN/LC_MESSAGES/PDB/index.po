"PDB (Program Database) is a file format invented by Microsoft and which "
"contains debug information that can be consumed by debuggers and other "
"tools.  Since officially supported APIs exist on Windows for querying debug "
"information from PDBs even without the user understanding the internals of "
"the file format, a large ecosystem of tools has been built for Windows to "
"consume this format.  In order for Clang to be able to generate programs "
"that can interoperate with these tools, it is necessary for us to generate "
"PDB files ourselves."

"At the same time, LLVM has a long history of being able to cross-compile "
"from any platform to any platform, and we wish for the same to be true "
"here.  So it is necessary for us to understand the PDB file format at the "
"byte-level so that we can generate PDB files entirely on our own."

"layout of the file, the various streams contained within, the format of "
"individual records within, and more."

"We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Microsoft, without whom "

"A PDB file is an MSF (Multi-Stream Format) file.  An MSF file is a \"file "
"system within a file\".  It contains multiple streams (aka files) which can "
"represent arbitrary data, and these streams are divided into blocks which "
"may not necessarily be contiguously laid out within the MSF container file. "
"Additionally, the MSF contains a stream directory (aka MFT) which describes "
"how the streams (files) are laid out within the MSF."

"The PDB format contains a number of streams which describe various "
"information such as the types, symbols, source files, and compilands (e.g. "
"object files) of a program, as well as some additional streams containing "
"hash tables that are used by debuggers and other tools to provide fast "
"lookup of records and types by name, and various other information about how "
"the program was compiled such as the specific toolchain used, and more.  A "
"summary of streams contained in a PDB file is as follows:"
