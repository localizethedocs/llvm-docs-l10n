msgid ""
":program:`llvm-objcopy` is a tool to copy and manipulate objects. In basic "
"usage, it makes a semantic copy of the input to the output. If any options "
"are specified, the output may be modified along the way, e.g. by removing "
"sections."

"If no output file is specified, the input file is modified in-place. If \"-"
