"The :program:`opt` command is the modular LLVM optimizer and analyzer.  It "
"takes LLVM source files as input, runs the specified optimizations or "
"analyses on it, and then outputs the optimized file. The optimizations "
"available via :program:`opt` depend upon what libraries were linked into it "
"as well as any additional libraries that have been loaded with the :option:`-"
"load` option.  Use the :option:`-help` option to determine what "
"optimizations you can use."

"If ``filename`` is omitted from the command line or is \"``-``\", :program:"
"`opt` reads its input from standard input.  Inputs can be in either the LLVM "
"assembly language format (``.ll``) or the LLVM bitcode format (``.bc``)."

"Enable binary output on terminals.  Normally, :program:`opt` will refuse to "

":program:`opt` provides the ability to run any of LLVM's optimization or "
"analysis passes in any order.  The :option:`-help` option lists all the "
"passes available.  The order in which the options occur on the command line "
"are the order in which they are executed (within pass constraints)."

"This option causes opt to strip debug information from the module before "
"applying other optimizations.  It is essentially the same as `-strip` but it "
"ensures that stripping of debug information is done first."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/opt.rst:64
msgid ""
"This option causes opt to add a verify pass after every pass otherwise "
"specified on the command line (including `-verify`).  This is useful for "
"cases where it is suspected that a pass is creating an invalid module but it "
"is not clear which pass is doing it."

"Load the dynamic object ``plugin``.  This object should register new "
