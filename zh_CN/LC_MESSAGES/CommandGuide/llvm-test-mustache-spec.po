"To test against the spec, simply download the spec and pass the test JSON "
"files to the driver. Each spec file should have a list of tests for "
"compliance with the spec. These are loaded as test cases, and rendered with "
"our Mustache implementation, which is then compared against the expected "
"output from the spec."

"The current implementation only supports non-optional parts of the spec, so "
"we do not expect any of the dynamic-names, inheritance, or lambda tests to "
"pass. Additionally, Triple Mustache is not supported. Unsupported tests are "
"marked as XFail and are removed from the XFail list as they are fixed."
