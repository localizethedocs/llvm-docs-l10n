"In basic usage, it makes a semantic copy of the input to the output. If any "
"options are specified, the output may be modified along the way, e.g. by "
"removing unused debug info."

"If \"-\" is specified for the input file, the input is read from the "

msgid ""
"Removes pieces of debug information related to discarded sections. When the "
"linker does section garbage collection the abandoned debug info is left "
"behind. Such abandoned debug info references address ranges using tombstone "
"values. Thus, when this option is specified, the tool removes debug info "
"which is marked with the tombstone value."

"Remove duplicated types (if \"One Definition Rule\" is supported by source "
