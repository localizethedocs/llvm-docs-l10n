msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:14
msgid ""
":program:`llvm-exegesis` is a benchmarking tool that uses information "
"available in LLVM to measure host machine instruction characteristics like "
"latency, throughput, or port decomposition."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:18
msgid ""
"Given an LLVM opcode name and a benchmarking mode, :program:`llvm-exegesis` "
"generates a code snippet that makes execution as serial (resp. as parallel) "
"as possible so that we can measure the latency (resp. inverse throughput/uop "
"decomposition) of the instruction. The code snippet is jitted and executed "
"on the host subtarget. The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured "
"using hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML to "
"the standard output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:26
msgid ""
"The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's "
"TableDef scheduling models. To that end, we also provide analysis of the "
"results."

":program:`llvm-exegesis` can also benchmark arbitrary user-provided code "

"Real-life code snippets typically depend on registers or memory. :program:"

msgid ""
"Mark the register as requiring a definition. :program:`llvm-exegesis` will "
"automatically assign a value to the register. This can be done using the "
"directive `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <reg name> <hex_value>`, where `<hex_value>` "
"is a bit pattern used to fill `<reg_name>`. If `<hex_value>` is smaller than "
"the register width, it will be sign-extended."
