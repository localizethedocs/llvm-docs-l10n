"This pass transforms generic machine instructions into equivalent target-"
"specific instructions.  It traverses the ``MachineFunction`` bottom-up, "
"selecting uses before definitions, enabling trivial dead code elimination."

"The target implements the ``InstructionSelector`` class, containing the "
"target-specific selection logic proper."

msgid ""
"The instance is provided by the subtarget, so that it can specialize the "
"selector by subtarget feature (with, e.g., a vector selector overriding "
"parts of a general-purpose common selector). We might also want to "
"parameterize it by MachineFunction, to enable selector variants based on "
"function attributes like optsize."

msgid ""
"This target-provided method is responsible for mutating (or replacing) a "
"possibly-generic MI into a fully target-specific equivalent. It is also "
"responsible for doing the necessary constraining of gvregs into the "
"appropriate register classes as well as passing through COPY instructions to "
"the register allocator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../GlobalISel/InstructionSelect.rst:37
msgid ""
"The ``InstructionSelector`` can fold other instructions into the selected "
"MI, by walking the use-def chain of the vreg operands. As GlobalISel is "
"Global, this folding can occur across basic blocks."

"TableGen will import SelectionDAG rules and provide the following function "
"to execute them:"

#: ../../../GlobalISel/InstructionSelect.rst:51
msgid ""
"The ``--stats`` option can be used to determine what proportion of rules "
"were successfully imported. The easiest way to use this is to copy the ``-"
"gen-globalisel`` tablegen command from ``ninja -v`` and modify it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../GlobalISel/InstructionSelect.rst:55
msgid ""
"Similarly, the ``--warn-on-skipped-patterns`` option can be used to obtain "
"the reasons that rules weren't imported. This can be used to focus on the "
"most important rejection reasons."

msgid ""
"PatLeafs cannot be imported because their C++ is implemented in terms of "
"``SDNode`` objects. PatLeafs that handle immediate predicates should be "
"replaced by ``ImmLeaf``, ``IntImmLeaf``, or ``FPImmLeaf`` as appropriate."
msgstr ""

"There's no standard answer for other PatLeafs. Some standard predicates have "
"been baked into TableGen but this should not generally be done."

#: ../../../GlobalISel/InstructionSelect.rst:72
msgid ""
"Custom SDNodes should be mapped to Target Pseudos using ``GINodeEquiv``. "
"This will cause the instruction selector to import them but you will also "
"need to ensure the target pseudo is introduced to the MIR before the "
"instruction selector. Any preceding pass is suitable but the legalizer will "
"be a particularly common choice."
