"Basically you have to do two things at a minimum. First, decide whether the "
"bug `crashes the compiler`_ or if the compiler is `miscompiling`_ the "
"program (i.e., the compiler successfully produces an executable, but it "
"doesn't run right). Based on what type of bug it is, follow the instructions "
"in the linked section to narrow down the bug so that the person who fixes it "
"will be able to find the problem more easily."

"If clang successfully produces an executable, but that executable doesn't "

"the program is clean under various `sanitizers <https://github.com/google/"
"sanitizers>`_ (e.g. ``clang -fsanitize=undefined,address``) and `valgrind "
"<http://valgrind.org/>`_. Many \"LLVM bugs\" that we have chased down ended "

"Similarly to debugging incorrect compilation by mis-behaving passes, you can "
