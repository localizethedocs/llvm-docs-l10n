"This document is meant to be a normative spec about the TableGen language in "
"and of itself (i.e. how to understand a given construct in terms of how it "
"affects the final set of records represented by the TableGen file). If you "

"The lexical and syntax notation used here is intended to imitate "
"`Python's`_. In particular, for lexical definitions, the productions operate "
"at the character level and there is no implied whitespace between elements. "
"The syntax definitions operate at the token level, so there is implied "
"whitespace between tokens."

msgstr ""
