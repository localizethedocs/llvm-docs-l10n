msgid ""
":program:`lit` is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test "
"suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures. :"
"program:`lit` is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a "
"user interface as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:17
msgid ""
":program:`lit` should be run with one or more *tests* to run specified on "
"the command line.  Tests can be either individual test files or directories "
"to search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`)."

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:21
msgid ""
"Each specified test will be executed (potentially in parallel) and once all "
"tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the "
"number of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`).  "

"tests fail."

"In the :program:`lit` model, every test must exist inside some *test "
