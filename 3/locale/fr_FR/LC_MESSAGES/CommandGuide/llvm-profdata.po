"By default profile data is merged without modification. This means that the "
"relative importance of each input file is proportional to the number of "
"samples or counts it contains. In general, the input from a longer training "
"run will be interpreted as relatively more important than a shorter run. "

"weight given to each input file by using the ``-weighted-input`` option."
