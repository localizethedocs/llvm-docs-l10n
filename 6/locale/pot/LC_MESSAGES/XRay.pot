msgid "Instrumenting your C/C++/Objective-C Application"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:55
msgid ""
"The easiest way of getting XRay instrumentation for your application is by "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:58
msgid "For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:64
msgid ""
"By default, functions that have at least 200 instructions will get XRay "
"instrumentation points. You can tweak that number through the ``-fxray-"
"instruction-threshold=`` flag:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:72
msgid ""
"You can also specifically instrument functions in your binary to either "
"always or never be instrumented using source-level attributes. You can do it "
"using the GCC-style attributes or C++11-style attributes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:86
msgid ""
"When linking a binary, you can either manually link in the `XRay Runtime "
"Library`_ or use ``clang`` to link it in automatically with the ``-fxray-"
"instrument`` flag. Alternatively, you can statically link-in the XRay "
"runtime library from compiler-rt -- those archive files will take the name "
"of `libclang_rt.xray-{arch}` where `{arch}` is the mnemonic supported by "
"clang (x86_64, arm7, etc.)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:123

"The XRay Runtime Library is part of the compiler-rt project, which "

"of inserted instrumentation points. When you use ``clang`` to link your "
"binaries and the ``-fxray-instrument`` flag, it will automatically link in "
"the XRay runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:128
msgid ""
"The default implementation of the XRay runtime will enable XRay "
"instrumentation before ``main`` starts, which works for applications that "

msgid ""
"The function should be thread-safe, as multiple threads may be invoking the "

"synchronisation guarantees outside from the atomicity of updates to the "
"pointer."

msgid "Flight Data Recorder Mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:203
msgid ""
"XRay supports a logging mode which allows the application to only capture a "
"fixed amount of memory's worth of events. Flight Data Recorder (FDR) mode "
"works very much like a plane's \"black box\" which keeps recording data to "
"memory in a fixed-size circular queue of buffers, and have the data "
"available programmatically until the buffers are finalized and flushed. To "
"use FDR mode on your application, you may set the ``xray_fdr_log`` option to "
"``true`` in the ``XRAY_OPTIONS`` environment variable (while also optionally "
"setting the ``xray_naive_log`` to ``false``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:215
msgid ""
"When FDR mode is on, it will keep writing and recycling memory buffers until "
"the logging implementation is finalized -- at which point it can be flushed "
"and re-initialised later. To do this programmatically, we follow the "
"workflow provided below:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:241
msgid ""
"The default settings for the FDR mode implementation will create logs named "
"similarly to the naive log implementation, but will have a different log "
"format. All the trace analysis tools (and the trace reading library) will "
"support all versions of the FDR mode format as we add more functionality and "
"record types in the future."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../XRay.rst:247
