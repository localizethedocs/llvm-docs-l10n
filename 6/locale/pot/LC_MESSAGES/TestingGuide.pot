"The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some "

#: ../../../TestingGuide.rst:177

"In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must have "
"a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine "
"how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very "
"flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If you're "
"adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from another "
"directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply specifies "
"which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains only "

"RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the "

"shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable "
"substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell "
"script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`. "
"Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify "
"as many RUN lines as needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../TestingGuide.rst:201
msgid ""
":program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool "

"Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless its "

"pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines ending in "
"``\\`` are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in ``\\`` is "
"found. This concatenated set of RUN lines then constitutes one execution. :"

"should treat everything enclosed as one value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../TestingGuide.rst:233
msgid ""
"In general, you should strive to keep your RUN lines as simple as possible, "

"The ``test-suite`` module contains a number of programs that can be compiled "
"and executed. The ``test-suite`` includes reference outputs for all of the "
"programs, so that the output of the executed program can be checked for "
"correctness."

"``test-suite`` tests are divided into three types of tests: MultiSource, "
