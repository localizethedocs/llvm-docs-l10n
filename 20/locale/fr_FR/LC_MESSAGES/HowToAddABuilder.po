"In 2020, the monorepo had just under 35 thousand commits.  This works out to "
"an average of 4 commits per hour.  Already, we can see that a builder must "
"cycle in less than 15 minutes to have a hope of being useful.  However, "
"those commits are not uniformly distributed.  They tend to cluster strongly "
"during US working hours.  Looking at a couple of recent (Nov 2021) working "
"days, we routinely see ~10 commits per hour during peek times, with "
"occasional spikes as high as ~15 commits per hour.  Thus, as a rule of "
"thumb, we should plan for our builder to complete ~10-15 builds an hour."

msgid "Resource Appropriately"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HowToAddABuilder.rst:290
msgid ""
"At 10-15 builds per hour, we need to complete a new build on average every 4 "
"to 6 minutes.  For anything except the fastest of hardware/build configs, "
"this is going to be well beyond the ability of a single machine.  In "
"buildbot terms, we likely going to need multiple workers to build requests "
"in parallel under a single builder configuration.  For some rough back of "
"the envelope numbers, if your build config takes e.g. 30 minutes, you will "
"need something on the order of 5-8 workers.  If your build config takes ~2 "
"hours, you'll need something on the order of 20-30 workers.  The rest of "
"this section focuses on how to reduce cycle times."

msgid "Restrict what you build and test"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HowToAddABuilder.rst:301
msgid ""
"Think hard about why you're setting up a bot, and restrict your build "
"configuration as much as you can.  Basic functionality is probably already "
"covered by other bots, and you don't need to duplicate that testing.  You "
"only need to be building and testing the *unique* parts of the "
"configuration.  (e.g. For a multi-stage clang builder, you probably don't "
"need to be enabling every target or building all the various utilities.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HowToAddABuilder.rst:308
msgid ""
"It can sometimes be worthwhile splitting a single builder into two or more, "
"if you have multiple distinct purposes for the same builder.  As an example, "
"if you want to both a) confirm that all of LLVM builds with your host "
"compiler, and b) want to do a multi-stage clang build on your target, you "
"may be better off with two separate bots.  Splitting increases resource "
"consumption, but makes it easy for each bot to keep up with commit flow. "
"Additionally, splitting bots may assist in triage by narrowing attention to "
"relevant parts of the failing configuration."

"In general, we recommend Release build types with Assertions enabled.  This "
"generally provides a good balance between build times and bug detection for "

"Ninja really does help build times over Make, particularly for highly "

"during linking significantly.  With a build machine with sufficient "
"parallelism, link times tend to dominate critical path of the build, and are "

"Using ccache materially improves average build times.  Incremental builds "

"g. state changes, etc...  At this point, the recommendation is not to use "
"incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the "
"majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HowToAddABuilder.rst:337
msgid ""
"One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the builder "
"less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built. If a change "
"triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output (e.g. doc "
"changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely hit in "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../HowToAddABuilder.rst:348

"CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access "
