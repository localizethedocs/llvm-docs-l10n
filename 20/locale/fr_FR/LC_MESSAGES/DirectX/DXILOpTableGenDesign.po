"DXIL backend passes depend on various properties of DXIL Operations. For "
"example, ``DXILOpLowering`` pass will need information such as the DXIL "
"operation an LLVM intrinsic is to be lowered to, along with valid overload "
"and argument types etc. The TableGen file - ``llvm/lib/Target/DirectX/DXIL."
"td`` - is used to represent DXIL Operations by specifying their properties "
"listed above. ``DXIL.td`` is designed to be the single source of reference "
"of DXIL Operations primarily for the implementation of passes in DXIL "
"backend in ``llvm-project`` repo - analogous to ``hctdb.py`` for "
"``DirectXShadeCompiler`` repo. However, the current design does not intend "
"to encapsulate various validation rules, present in ``hctdb.py``, but do not "
"pertain to DXIL Operations. It needs to have a rich representation "
"capabilities that TableGen backends (such as ``DXILEmitter``) can rely on. "
