msgid ""
":program:`llvm-tli-checker` compares TargetLibraryInfo's opinion of the "
"availability of library functions against the set of functions exported by "
"the specified library files, reporting any disagreements between TLI's "
"opinion and whether the function is actually present. This is primarily "
"useful for vendors to ensure the TLI for their target is correct, and the "
"compiler will not \"optimize\" some code sequence into a library call that "
"is not actually available."

"The amount of information to report.  <level> can be summary, discrepancy, "
"or full. A summary report gives only the count of matching and mis-matching "
"symbols; discrepancy lists the mis-matching symbols; and full lists all "
"symbols known to TLI, matching or mis-matching. The default is discrepancy."

"Read and report a summary for each library file separately.  This can be "
