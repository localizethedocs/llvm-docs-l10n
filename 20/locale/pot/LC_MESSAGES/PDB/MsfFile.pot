"**BlockSize** - The block size of the internal file system.  Valid values "

"**FreeBlockMapBlock** - The index of a block within the file, at which "
"begins a bitfield representing the set of all blocks within the file which "

"`msf_freeblockmap` for more information. **Important**: "

"**BlockMapAddr** - The index of a block within the MSF file.  At this block "

"describes the block layout of each stream) may not fit entirely on a single "
"block.  As a result, this extra layer of indirection is introduced, whereby "
"this block contains the list of blocks that the stream directory occupies, "

"Each file contains two FPMs, one of which is active at any given time. This "

"underlying MSF file. While writing to an MSF file, if the active FPM is "
"FPM1, you can write your new modified bitfield to FPM2, and vice versa. Only "

"The Free Block Maps are stored as a series of single blocks throughout the "
"file at intervals of BlockSize. Because each FPM block is of size "
"``BlockSize`` bytes, it contains 8 times as many bits as an interval has "
"blocks. This means that the first block of each FPM refers to the first 8 "
"intervals of the file (the first 32768 blocks), the second block of each FPM "
"refers to the next 8 blocks, and so on. This results in far more FPM blocks "
"being present than are required, but in order to maintain backwards "
"compatibility the format must stay this way."

"As may be clear by now, it is possible for a single field (whether it be a "
"high level record, a long string field, or even a single ``uint16``) to "
"begin and end in separate blocks.  For example, if the block size is 4096 "
"bytes, and a ``uint16`` field begins at the last byte of the current block, "
"then it would need to end on the first byte of the next block.  Since blocks "
"are not necessarily contiguously laid out in the file, this means that both "
"the consumer and the producer of an MSF file must be prepared to split data "
"apart accordingly.  In the aforementioned example, the high byte of the "
"``uint16`` would be written to the last byte of block N, and the low byte "
"would be written to the first byte of block N+1, which could be tens of "
"thousands of bytes later (or even earlier!) in the file, depending on what "
"the stream directory says."
