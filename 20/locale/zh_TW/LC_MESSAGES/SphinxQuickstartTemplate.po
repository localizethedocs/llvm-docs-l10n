"LLVM documentation is written in `reStructuredText`_, a markup syntax "
"similar to markdown (but much more powerful). The LLVM documentation site "
"itself uses `Sphinx`_, a documentation generator originally written for "
"Python documentation."

msgid ""
"This article is located in ``docs/SphinxQuickstartTemplate.rst``. To use it "
"as a template, make a copy and open it in a text editor. You can then write "
"your docs, and then send the new article to llvm-commits for review."

"Focus on *content*. It is easy to fix the Sphinx (reStructuredText) syntax "
"later if necessary, although reStructuredText tries to imitate common plain-"
"text conventions so it should be quite natural. A basic knowledge of "
"reStructuredText syntax is useful when writing the document, so the last "
"~half of this document (starting with `Example Section`_) gives examples "
"which should cover 99% of use cases."

"Let me say that again: focus on *content*. But if you really need to verify "
"Sphinx's output, see ``docs/README.txt`` for information. Once you have "
"finished with the content, please send the ``.rst`` file to llvm-commits for "
"review."

"A standard best practice is to make your articles task-oriented. You "
"generally should not be writing documentation that isn't based around \"how "
"to\" do something unless there's already an existing \"how to\" article for "
"the topic you're documenting. The reason for this is that without a \"how "
"to\" article to read first, it might be difficult for someone unfamiliar "
"with the topic to understand a more advanced, conceptual article."

#: ../../../SphinxQuickstartTemplate.rst:54

"When creating a task-oriented article, follow existing LLVM articles by "

"An article can contain one or more sections (i.e., headings). Sections (like "
"``Example Section`` above) help give your document its structure. Use the "
"same kind of adornments (e.g. ``======`` vs. ``------``) as are used in this "
