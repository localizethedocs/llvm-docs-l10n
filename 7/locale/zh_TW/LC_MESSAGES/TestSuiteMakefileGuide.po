"This document describes the features of the Makefile-based LLVM test-suite "
"as well as the cmake based replacement. This way of interacting with the "
"test-suite is deprecated in favor of running the test-suite using LNT, but "
"may continue to prove useful for some users. See the Testing Guide's :ref:"
"`test-suite Quickstart <test-suite-quickstart>` section for more information."

"The ``test-suite`` module contains a number of programs that can be compiled "
"with LLVM and executed. These programs are compiled using the native "
"compiler and various LLVM backends. The output from the program compiled "
"with the native compiler is assumed correct; the results from the other "
"programs are compared to the native program output and pass if they match."

"When executing tests, it is usually a good idea to start out with a subset "
"of the available tests or programs. This makes test run times smaller at "
"first and later on this is useful to investigate individual test failures. "
"To run some test only on a subset of programs, simply change directory to "
"the programs you want tested and run ``gmake`` there. Alternatively, you can "
"run a different test using the ``TEST`` variable to change what tests or run "
"on the selected programs (see below for more info)."

"In addition for testing correctness, the ``test-suite`` directory also "
"performs timing tests of various LLVM optimizations. It also records "
"compilation times for the compilers and the JIT. This information can be "
"used to compare the effectiveness of LLVM's optimizations and code "
"generation."

"The External directory contains Makefiles for building code that is external "
"to (i.e., not distributed with) LLVM. The most prominent members of this "

"presence and location of these external programs is configured by the test-"
"suite ``configure`` script."

"\"``test-suite/TEST.XXX.report``\" file that indicates how to format the "
