"Welcome to Chapter 2 of the \"Building an ORC-based JIT in LLVM\" tutorial. "
"In `Chapter 1 <BuildingAJIT1.html>`_ of this series we examined a basic JIT "
"class, KaleidoscopeJIT, that could take LLVM IR modules as input and produce "
"executable code in memory. KaleidoscopeJIT was able to do this with "
"relatively little code by composing two off-the-shelf *ORC layers*: "
"IRCompileLayer and ObjectLinkingLayer, to do much of the heavy lifting."

"In this layer we'll learn more about the ORC layer concept by using a new "

"In `Chapter 4 <LangImpl04.html>`_ of the \"Implementing a language with "
"LLVM\" tutorial series the llvm *FunctionPassManager* is introduced as a "
"means for optimizing LLVM IR. Interested readers may read that chapter for "
"details, but in short: to optimize a Module we create an llvm::"
"FunctionPassManager instance, configure it with a set of optimizations, then "
"run the PassManager on a Module to mutate it into a (hopefully) more "
"optimized but semantically equivalent form. In the original tutorial series "
"the FunctionPassManager was created outside the KaleidoscopeJIT and modules "
"were optimized before being added to it. In this Chapter we will make "
"optimization a phase of our JIT instead. For now this will provide us a "
"motivation to learn more about ORC layers, but in the long term making "
"optimization part of our JIT will yield an important benefit: When we begin "
"lazily compiling code (i.e. deferring compilation of each function until the "
"first time it's run), having optimization managed by our JIT will allow us "
"to optimize lazily too, rather than having to do all our optimization up-"
"front."

msgid ""
"To add optimization support to our JIT we will take the KaleidoscopeJIT from "
"Chapter 1 and compose an ORC *IRTransformLayer* on top. We will look at how "
"the IRTransformLayer works in more detail below, but the interface is "
"simple: the constructor for this layer takes a reference to the layer below "
"(as all layers do) plus an *IR optimization function* that it will apply to "
"each Module that is added via addModule:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst:84
msgid ""
"Our extended KaleidoscopeJIT class starts out the same as it did in Chapter "
"1, but after the CompileLayer we introduce a typedef for our optimization "
"function. In this case we use a std::function (a handy wrapper for "
"\"function-like\" things) from a single unique_ptr<Module> input to a std::"
"unique_ptr<Module> output. With our optimization function typedef in place "
"we can declare our OptimizeLayer, which sits on top of our CompileLayer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst:91
msgid ""
"To initialize our OptimizeLayer we pass it a reference to the CompileLayer "
"below (standard practice for layers), and we initialize the OptimizeFunction "
"using a lambda that calls out to an \"optimizeModule\" function that we will "
"define below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst:126
msgid ""
"Next we need to replace references to 'CompileLayer' with references to "
"OptimizeLayer in our key methods: addModule, findSymbol, and removeModule. "
"In addModule we need to be careful to replace both references: the "
"findSymbol call inside our resolver, and the call through to addModule."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst:152
msgid ""
"At the bottom of our JIT we add a private method to do the actual "
"optimization: *optimizeModule*. This function sets up a FunctionPassManager, "
"adds some passes to it, runs it over every function in the module, and then "
"returns the mutated module. The specific optimizations are the same ones "
"used in `Chapter 4 <LangImpl04.html>`_ of the \"Implementing a language with "
"LLVM\" tutorial series. Readers may visit that chapter for a more in-depth "
"discussion of these, and of IR optimization in general."

"And that's it in terms of changes to KaleidoscopeJIT: When a module is added "
"via addModule the OptimizeLayer will call our optimizeModule function before "
"passing the transformed module on to the CompileLayer below. Of course, we "
"could have called optimizeModule directly in our addModule function and not "
"gone to the bother of using the IRTransformLayer, but doing so gives us "
"another opportunity to see how layers compose. It also provides a neat entry "
"point to the *layer* concept itself, because IRTransformLayer turns out to "
"be one of the simplest implementations of the layer concept that can be "
"devised:"

"This is the whole definition of IRTransformLayer, from ``llvm/include/llvm/"
"ExecutionEngine/Orc/IRTransformLayer.h``, stripped of its comments. It is a "
"template class with two template arguments: ``BaesLayerT`` and "
"``TransformFtor`` that provide the type of the base layer and the type of "
"the \"transform functor\" (in our case a std::function) respectively. This "
"class is concerned with two very simple jobs: (1) Running every IR Module "
"that is added with addModule through the transform functor, and (2) "
"conforming to the ORC layer interface. The interface consists of one typedef "
"and five methods:"

"This interface attempts to capture the natural operations of a JIT (with "
"some wrinkles like emitAndFinalize for performance), similar to the basic "
"JIT API operations we identified in Chapter 1. Conforming to the layer "
"concept allows classes to compose neatly by implementing their behaviors in "
"terms of the these same operations, carried out on the layer below. For "
"example, an eager layer (like IRTransformLayer) can implement addModule by "
"running each module in the set through its transform up-front and "
"immediately passing the result to the layer below. A lazy layer, by "
"contrast, could implement addModule by squirreling away the modules doing no "
"other up-front work, but applying the transform (and calling addModule on "
"the layer below) when the client calls findSymbol instead. The JIT'd program "
"behavior will be the same either way, but these choices will have different "
"performance characteristics: Doing work eagerly means the JIT takes longer "
"up-front, but proceeds smoothly once this is done. Deferring work allows the "
"JIT to get up-and-running quickly, but will force the JIT to pause and wait "
"whenever some code or data is needed that hasn't already been processed."

"Our current REPL is eager: Each function definition is optimized and "
"compiled as soon as it's typed in. If we were to make the transform layer "
"lazy (but not change things otherwise) we could defer optimization until the "
"first time we reference a function in a top-level expression (see if you can "
"figure out why, then check out the answer below [1]_). In the next chapter, "
"however we'll introduce fully lazy compilation, in which function's aren't "
"compiled until they're first called at run-time. At this point the trade-"
"offs get much more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start "
"executing the first function, but the more often we'll have to pause to "
"compile newly encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but "
"optimize eagerly, we'll have a slow startup (which everything is optimized) "
"but relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. "
"If we both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first "
"function more quickly, but we'll have longer pauses as each function has to "
"be both optimized and code-gen'd when it's first executed. Things become "
"even more interesting if we consider interproceedural optimizations like "
"inlining, which must be performed eagerly. These are complex trade-offs, and "
"there is no one-size-fits all solution to them, but by providing composable "
"layers we leave the decisions to the person implementing the JIT, and make "
"it easy for them to experiment with different configurations."
