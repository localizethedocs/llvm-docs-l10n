"Welcome to Chapter 2 of the \"`Implementing a language with LLVM in "

"`parser <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing>`_ for our Kaleidoscope "

"The AST for a program captures its behavior in such a way that it is easy "
"for later stages of the compiler (e.g. code generation) to interpret. We "

"The code above shows the definition of the base ExprAST class and one "
"subclass which we use for numeric literals. The important thing to note "

"This is all (intentionally) rather straight-forward: variables capture the "

"Now that we have an AST to build, we need to define the parser code to build "

"returned as three tokens by the lexer) into an AST that could be generated "
"with calls like this:"
msgstr ""

"The error handling routines make use of the builtin ``Stream.Failure`` and "
"``Stream.Error``s. ``Stream.Failure`` is raised when the parser is unable to "
"find any matching token in the first position of a pattern. ``Stream.Error`` "
"is raised when the first token matches, but the rest do not. The error "
"recovery in our parser will not be the best and is not particular user-"

"We start with numeric literals, because they are the simplest to process. "
"For each production in our grammar, we'll define a function which parses "
"that production. We call this class of expressions \"primary\" expressions, "
"for reasons that will become more clear `later in the tutorial "
"<OCamlLangImpl6.html#user-defined-unary-operators>`_. In order to parse an "
"arbitrary primary expression, we need to determine what sort of expression "
"it is. For numeric literals, we have:"

"This routine is very simple: it expects to be called when the current token "
"is a ``Token.Number`` token. It takes the current number value, creates a "
"``Ast.Number`` node, advances the lexer to the next token, and finally "
"returns."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:152
msgid ""
"There are some interesting aspects to this. The most important one is that "
"this routine eats all of the tokens that correspond to the production and "
"returns the lexer buffer with the next token (which is not part of the "
"grammar production) ready to go. This is a fairly standard way to go for "
"recursive descent parsers. For a better example, the parenthesis operator is "
"defined like this:"

"This function illustrates a number of interesting things about the parser:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:167
msgid ""
"1) It shows how we use the ``Stream.Error`` exception. When called, this "
"function expects that the current token is a '(' token, but after parsing "
"the subexpression, it is possible that there is no ')' waiting. For example, "
"if the user types in \"(4 x\" instead of \"(4)\", the parser should emit an "
"error. Because errors can occur, the parser needs a way to indicate that "
"they happened. In our parser, we use the camlp4 shortcut syntax ``token ?? "
"\"parse error\"``, where if the token before the ``??`` does not match, then "
"``Stream.Error \"parse error\"`` will be raised."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:177
msgid ""
"2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion by "
"calling ``Parser.parse_primary`` (we will soon see that ``Parser."
"parse_primary`` can call ``Parser.parse_primary``). This is powerful because "
"it allows us to handle recursive grammars, and keeps each production very "
"simple. Note that parentheses do not cause construction of AST nodes "
"themselves. While we could do it this way, the most important role of "
"parentheses are to guide the parser and provide grouping. Once the parser "
"constructs the AST, parentheses are not needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:187
msgid ""
"The next simple production is for handling variable references and function "
"calls:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:216
msgid ""
"This routine follows the same style as the other routines. (It expects to be "
"called if the current token is a ``Token.Ident`` token). It also has "
"recursion and error handling. One interesting aspect of this is that it uses "
"*look-ahead* to determine if the current identifier is a stand alone "
"variable reference or if it is a function call expression. It handles this "
"by checking to see if the token after the identifier is a '(' token, "
"constructing either a ``Ast.Variable`` or ``Ast.Call`` node as appropriate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:225
msgid ""
"We finish up by raising an exception if we received a token we didn't expect:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:232
msgid ""
"Now that basic expressions are handled, we need to handle binary "
"expressions. They are a bit more complex."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:236
msgid "Binary Expression Parsing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:238
msgid ""
"Binary expressions are significantly harder to parse because they are often "
"ambiguous. For example, when given the string \"x+y\\*z\", the parser can "
"choose to parse it as either \"(x+y)\\*z\" or \"x+(y\\*z)\". With common "
"definitions from mathematics, we expect the later parse, because "
"\"\\*\" (multiplication) has higher *precedence* than \"+\" (addition)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:244
msgid ""
"There are many ways to handle this, but an elegant and efficient way is to "
"use `Operator-Precedence Parsing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-"
"precedence_parser>`_. This parsing technique uses the precedence of binary "
"operators to guide recursion. To start with, we need a table of precedences:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:270
msgid ""
"For the basic form of Kaleidoscope, we will only support 4 binary operators "
"(this can obviously be extended by you, our brave and intrepid reader). The "
"``Parser.precedence`` function returns the precedence for the current token, "
"or -1 if the token is not a binary operator. Having a ``Hashtbl.t`` makes it "
"easy to add new operators and makes it clear that the algorithm doesn't "
"depend on the specific operators involved, but it would be easy enough to "
"eliminate the ``Hashtbl.t`` and do the comparisons in the ``Parser."
"precedence`` function. (Or just use a fixed-size array)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:280
msgid ""
"With the helper above defined, we can now start parsing binary expressions. "
"The basic idea of operator precedence parsing is to break down an expression "
"with potentially ambiguous binary operators into pieces. Consider, for "
"example, the expression \"a+b+(c+d)\\*e\\*f+g\". Operator precedence parsing "
"considers this as a stream of primary expressions separated by binary "
"operators. As such, it will first parse the leading primary expression "
"\"a\", then it will see the pairs [+, b] [+, (c+d)] [\\*, e] [\\*, f] and "
"[+, g]. Note that because parentheses are primary expressions, the binary "
"expression parser doesn't need to worry about nested subexpressions like "
"(c+d) at all."

msgid ""
"To start, an expression is a primary expression potentially followed by a "
"sequence of [binop,primaryexpr] pairs:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:301
msgid ""
"``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` is the function that parses the sequence of pairs "
"for us. It takes a precedence and a pointer to an expression for the part "
"that has been parsed so far. Note that \"x\" is a perfectly valid "
"expression: As such, \"binoprhs\" is allowed to be empty, in which case it "
"returns the expression that is passed into it. In our example above, the "
"code passes the expression for \"a\" into ``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` and the "
"current token is \"+\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:309
msgid ""
"The precedence value passed into ``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` indicates the "
"*minimal operator precedence* that the function is allowed to eat. For "
"example, if the current pair stream is [+, x] and ``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` "
"is passed in a precedence of 40, it will not consume any tokens (because the "
"precedence of '+' is only 20). With this in mind, ``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` "
"starts with:"

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:330
msgid ""
"This code gets the precedence of the current token and checks to see if if "
"is too low. Because we defined invalid tokens to have a precedence of -1, "
"this check implicitly knows that the pair-stream ends when the token stream "
"runs out of binary operators. If this check succeeds, we know that the token "
"is a binary operator and that it will be included in this expression:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:350
msgid ""
"As such, this code eats (and remembers) the binary operator and then parses "
"the primary expression that follows. This builds up the whole pair, the "
"first of which is [+, b] for the running example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:354
msgid ""
"Now that we parsed the left-hand side of an expression and one pair of the "
"RHS sequence, we have to decide which way the expression associates. In "
"particular, we could have \"(a+b) binop unparsed\" or \"a + (b binop "
"unparsed)\". To determine this, we look ahead at \"binop\" to determine its "
"precedence and compare it to BinOp's precedence (which is '+' in this case):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:368
msgid ""
"If the precedence of the binop to the right of \"RHS\" is lower or equal to "
"the precedence of our current operator, then we know that the parentheses "
"associate as \"(a+b) binop ...\". In our example, the current operator is \"+"
"\" and the next operator is \"+\", we know that they have the same "
"precedence. In this case we'll create the AST node for \"a+b\", and then "
"continue parsing:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:385
msgid ""
"In our example above, this will turn \"a+b+\" into \"(a+b)\" and execute the "
"next iteration of the loop, with \"+\" as the current token. The code above "
"will eat, remember, and parse \"(c+d)\" as the primary expression, which "
"makes the current pair equal to [+, (c+d)]. It will then evaluate the 'if' "
"conditional above with \"\\*\" as the binop to the right of the primary. In "
"this case, the precedence of \"\\*\" is higher than the precedence of \"+\" "
"so the if condition will be entered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:393
msgid ""
"The critical question left here is \"how can the if condition parse the "
"right hand side in full\"? In particular, to build the AST correctly for our "
"example, it needs to get all of \"(c+d)\\*e\\*f\" as the RHS expression "
"variable. The code to do this is surprisingly simple (code from the above "
"two blocks duplicated for context):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:416
msgid ""
"At this point, we know that the binary operator to the RHS of our primary "
"has higher precedence than the binop we are currently parsing. As such, we "
"know that any sequence of pairs whose operators are all higher precedence "
"than \"+\" should be parsed together and returned as \"RHS\". To do this, we "
"recursively invoke the ``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` function specifying "
"\"token\\_prec+1\" as the minimum precedence required for it to continue. In "
"our example above, this will cause it to return the AST node for "
"\"(c+d)\\*e\\*f\" as RHS, which is then set as the RHS of the '+' expression."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:426
msgid ""
"Finally, on the next iteration of the while loop, the \"+g\" piece is parsed "
"and added to the AST. With this little bit of code (14 non-trivial lines), "
"we correctly handle fully general binary expression parsing in a very "
"elegant way. This was a whirlwind tour of this code, and it is somewhat "
"subtle. I recommend running through it with a few tough examples to see how "
"it works."

"This wraps up handling of expressions. At this point, we can point the "

"The most interesting part of this is that we ignore top-level semicolons. "
