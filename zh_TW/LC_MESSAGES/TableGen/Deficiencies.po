"Despite being very generic, TableGen has some deficiencies that have been "
"pointed out numerous times. The common theme is that, while TableGen allows "
"you to build Domain-Specific-Languages, the final languages that you create "
"lack the power of other DSLs, which in turn increase considerably the size "
"and complexity of TableGen files."

"At the same time, TableGen allows you to create virtually any meaning of the "
"basic concepts via custom-made back-ends, which can pervert the original "
"design and make it very hard for newcomers to understand it."

"There are some in favour of extending the semantics even more, but making "
"sure back-ends adhere to strict rules. Others suggesting we should move to "
"more powerful DSLs designed with specific purposes, or even re-using "
"existing DSLs."
