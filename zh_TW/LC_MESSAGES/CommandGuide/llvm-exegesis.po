msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:14
msgid ""
":program:`llvm-exegesis` is a benchmarking tool that uses information "
"available in LLVM to measure host machine instruction characteristics like "
"latency, throughput, or port decomposition."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:18
msgid ""
"Given an LLVM opcode name and a benchmarking mode, :program:`llvm-exegesis` "
"generates a code snippet that makes execution as serial (resp. as parallel) "
"as possible so that we can measure the latency (resp. inverse throughput/uop "
"decomposition) of the instruction. The code snippet is jitted and, unless "
"requested not to, executed on the host subtarget. The time taken (resp. "
"resource usage) is measured using hardware performance counters. The result "
"is printed out as YAML to the standard output."

":program:`llvm-exegesis` supports benchmarking arbitrary snippets of "

"`LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name>` - Adding this annotation to the text "
"assembly snippet to be benchmarked marks the register as requiring a "

"is named using the `<value name>` argument so that it can be referenced "
"later within a map annotation. The size is specified in bytes the the value "
"is taken in hexadecimal. If the size of the value is less than the specified "
"size, the value will be repeated until it fills the entire section of "

"`LLVM-EXEGESIS-MEM-MAP <value name> <address>` - This annotation allows for "

"definition should start at. Note that a single memory definition can be "
