msgstr ""

msgid ""
":program:`llvm-mca` is a performance analysis tool that uses information "
"available in LLVM (e.g. scheduling models) to statically measure the "
"performance of machine code in a specific CPU."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-mca.rst:18
msgid ""
"Performance is measured in terms of throughput as well as processor resource "
"consumption. The tool currently works for processors with a backend for "
"which there is a scheduling model available in LLVM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-mca.rst:22
msgid ""

"Given an assembly code sequence, :program:`llvm-mca` estimates the "
