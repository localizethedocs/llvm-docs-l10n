msgid ""
":program:`llvm-strings` is a tool intended as a drop-in replacement for "
"GNU's :program:`strings`, which looks for printable strings in files and "
"writes them to the standard output stream. A printable string is any "
"sequence of four (by default) or more printable ASCII characters. The end of "
"the file, or any other byte, terminates the current sequence."

msgid ""
":program:`llvm-strings` looks for strings in each ``input`` file specified. "
"Unlike GNU :program:`strings` it looks in the entire input file, regardless "
"of file format, rather than restricting the search to certain sections of "
"object files. If \"``-``\" is specified as an ``input``, or no ``input`` is "
"specified, the program reads from the standard input stream."
