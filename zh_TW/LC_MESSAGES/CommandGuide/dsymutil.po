msgid ""
":program:`dsymutil` links the DWARF debug information found in the object "
"files for an executable *executable* by using debug symbols information "
"contained in its symbol table. By default, the linked debug information is "
"placed in a ``.dSYM`` bundle with the same name as the executable."

"Link DWARF debug information only for specified CPU architecture types. "
"Architectures may be specified by name. When using this option, an error "
"will be returned if any architectures can not be properly linked.  This "
"option can be specified multiple times, once for each desired architecture. "
"All CPU architectures will be linked by default and any architectures that "
"can't be properly linked will cause :program:`dsymutil` to return an error."

"When used when creating a dSYM file, this option will suppress the emission "
"of the .debug_inlines, .debug_pubnames, and .debug_pubtypes sections since "
"dsymutil currently has better equivalents: .apple_names and .apple_types. "
"When used in conjunction with --update option, this option will cause "
"redundant accelerator tables to be removed."
