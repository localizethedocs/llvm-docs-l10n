"**llvm-build** is a tool for working with LLVM projects that use the "
"LLVMBuild system for describing their components."

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-build.rst:17
msgid ""
"At heart, **llvm-build** is responsible for loading, verifying, and "
"manipulating the project's component data. The tool is primarily designed "
"for use in implementing build systems and tools which need access to the "
"project structure information."

"Write out new *LLVMBuild.txt* files based on the loaded components. This is "
