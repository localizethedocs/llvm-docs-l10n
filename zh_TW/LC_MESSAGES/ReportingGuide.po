"If the violation occurs at an event such as a Developer Meeting and requires "

"can locate one for you. We will also post detailed contact information for "
"specific events as part of each events' information. In person reports will "
"still be kept confidential exactly as above, but also feel free to "

"The LLVM community has long handled inappropriate behavior on its own, using "

"intended to discourage this self enforcement of community norms. Instead, "
"the mechanisms described here are intended to supplement any self "
"enforcement within the community. They provide avenues for handling severe "
"cases or cases where the reporting party does not wish to respond directly "
"for any reason."
