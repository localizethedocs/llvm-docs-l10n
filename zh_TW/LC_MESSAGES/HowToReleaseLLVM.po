"LLVM is released on a time based schedule --- with major releases roughly "

"release manager will determine if and when to make a dot release based on "
"feedback from the community.  Typically, dot releases should be made if "
"there are large number of bug-fixes in the stable branch or a critical bug "
"has been discovered that affects a large number of users."

"A release is qualified when it has no regressions from the previous release "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../HowToReleaseLLVM.rst:163

"Regressions are new failures in the set of tests that are used to qualify "

"software.  We need a very concrete and definitive release criteria that "
"ensures we have monotonically improving quality on some metric.  The metric "
"we use is described below.  This doesn't mean that we don't care about other "
