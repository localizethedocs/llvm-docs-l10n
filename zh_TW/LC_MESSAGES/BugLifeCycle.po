"We aim to achieve a basic level of consistency in how reported bugs evolve "
"from being reported, to being worked on, and finally getting closed out. The "
"consistency helps reporters, developers and others to gain a better "
"understanding of what a particular bug state actually means and what to "
"expect might happen next."
