"This document is meant to get you writing documentation as fast as possible "
"even if you have no previous experience with Sphinx. The goal is to take "
"someone in the state of \"I want to write documentation and get it added to "
"LLVM's docs\" and turn that into useful documentation mailed to llvm-commits "
"with as little nonsense as possible."

"You can find this document in ``docs/SphinxQuickstartTemplate.rst``. You "

"Focus on *content*. It is easy to fix the Sphinx (reStructuredText) syntax "
"later if necessary, although reStructuredText tries to imitate common plain-"
"text conventions so it should be quite natural. A basic knowledge of "
"reStructuredText syntax is useful when writing the document, so the last "
"~half of this document (starting with `Example Section`_) gives examples "
"which should cover 99% of use cases."

"You generally should not be writing documentation other than a \"how to\" "
