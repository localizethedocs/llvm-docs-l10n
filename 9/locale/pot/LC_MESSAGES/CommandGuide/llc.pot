msgid ""
"The :program:`llc` command compiles LLVM source inputs into assembly "
"language for a specified architecture.  The assembly language output can "
"then be passed through a native assembler and linker to generate a native "
"executable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llc.rst:18
msgid ""
"The choice of architecture for the output assembly code is automatically "
"determined from the input file, unless the :option:`-march` option is used "
"to override the default."

msgid ""
"If ``filename`` is \"``-``\" or omitted, :program:`llc` reads from standard "
"input. Otherwise, it will from ``filename``.  Inputs can be in either the "
"LLVM assembly language format (``.ll``) or the LLVM bitcode format (``.bc``)."

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llc.rst:29
msgid ""
"If the :option:`-o` option is omitted, then :program:`llc` will send its "
"output to standard output if the input is from standard input.  If the :"
"option:`-o` option specifies \"``-``\", then the output will also be sent to "
"standard output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llc.rst:33
msgid ""
"If no :option:`-o` option is specified and an input file other than \"``-"
"``\" is specified, then :program:`llc` creates the output filename by taking "
"the input filename, removing any existing ``.bc`` extension, and adding a ``."
