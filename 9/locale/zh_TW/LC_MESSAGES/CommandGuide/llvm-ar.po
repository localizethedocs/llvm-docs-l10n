#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-ar.rst:14
msgid ""
"The **llvm-ar** command is similar to the common Unix utility, ``ar``. It "
"archives several files together into a single file. The intent for this is "
"to produce archive libraries by LLVM bitcode that can be linked into an LLVM "
"program. However, the archive can contain any kind of file. By default, "
"**llvm-ar** generates a symbol table that makes linking faster because only "
"the symbol table needs to be consulted, not each individual file member of "
"the archive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-ar.rst:22
msgid ""
"The **llvm-ar** command can be used to *read* SVR4, GNU and BSD style "
"archive files. However, right now it can only write in the GNU format. If an "
"SVR4 or BSD style archive is used with the ``r`` (replace) or ``q`` (quick "
"update) operations, the archive will be reconstructed in GNU format."

msgid ""
"The options to **llvm-ar** are compatible with other ``ar`` implementations. "
"However, there are a few modifiers (*R*) that are not found in other ``ar`` "
"implementations. The options to **llvm-ar** specify a single basic operation "
"to perform on the archive, a variety of modifiers for that operation, the "
"name of the archive file, and an optional list of file names. These options "
"are used to determine how **llvm-ar** should process the archive file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-ar.rst:49
msgid ""
"The Operations and Modifiers are explained in the sections below. The "
"minimal set of options is at least one operator and the name of the archive. "
"Typically archive files end with a ``.a`` suffix, but this is not required. "
"Following the *archive-name* comes a list of *files* that indicate the "
"specific members of the archive to operate on. If the *files* option is not "
"specified, it generally means either \"none\" or \"all\" members, depending "
"on the operation."
