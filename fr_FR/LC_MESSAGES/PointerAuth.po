"Pointer Authentication is a mechanism by which certain pointers are signed. "
"When a pointer gets signed, a cryptographic hash of its value and other "
"values (pepper and salt) is stored in unused bits of that pointer."

"Before the pointer is used, it needs to be authenticated, i.e., have its "
"signature checked.  This prevents pointer values of unknown origin from "
"being used to replace the signed pointer value."
