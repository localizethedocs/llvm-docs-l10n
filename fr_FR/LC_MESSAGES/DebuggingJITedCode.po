"Without special runtime support, debugging dynamically generated code with "
"GDB (as well as most debuggers) can be quite painful.  Debuggers generally "
"read debug information from the object file of the code, but for JITed code, "
"there is no such file to look for."

"In order to communicate the necessary debug info to GDB, an interface for "
"registering JITed code with debuggers has been designed and implemented for "
"GDB and LLVM MCJIT.  At a high level, whenever MCJIT generates new machine "
"code, it does so in an in-memory object file that contains the debug "
"information in DWARF format.  MCJIT then adds this in-memory object file to "
"a global list of dynamically generated object files and calls a special "
"function (``__jit_debug_register_code``) marked noinline that GDB knows "
"about.  When GDB attaches to a process, it puts a breakpoint in this "
"function and loads all of the object files in the global list.  When MCJIT "
"calls the registration function, GDB catches the breakpoint signal, loads "
"the new object file from the inferior's memory, and resumes the execution.  "
"In this way, GDB can get the necessary debug information."

"In order to debug code JIT-ed by LLVM, you need GDB 7.0 or newer, which is "
"available on most modern distributions of Linux.  The version of GDB that "
"Apple ships with Xcode has been frozen at 6.3 for a while.  LLDB may be a "
"better option for debugging JIT-ed code on Mac OS X."

"The emerging MCJIT component of LLVM allows full debugging of JIT-ed code "
