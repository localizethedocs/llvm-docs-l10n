"The PDB DBI Stream (Index 3) is one of the largest and most important "
"streams in a PDB file.  It contains information about how the program was "
"compiled, (e.g. compilation flags, etc), the compilands (e.g. object files) "
"that were used to link together the program, the source files which were "
"used to build the program, as well as references to other streams that "
"contain more detailed information about each compiland, such as the CodeView "
"symbol records contained within each compiland and the source and line "
"information for functions and other symbols within each compiland."
