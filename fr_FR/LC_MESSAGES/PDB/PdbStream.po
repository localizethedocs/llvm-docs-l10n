"While the meaning of this field appears to be obvious, in practice we have "
"never observed a value other than ``VC70``, even with modern versions of the "
"toolchain, and it is unclear why the other values exist.  It is assumed that "
"certain aspects of the PDB stream's layout, and perhaps even that of the "
"other streams, will change if the value is something other than ``VC70``."

msgid ""
"**Signature** - A 32-bit time-stamp generated with a call to ``time()`` at "
"the time the PDB file is written.  Note that due to the inherent uniqueness "
"problems of using a timestamp with 1-second granularity, this field does not "
"really serve its intended purpose, and as such is typically ignored in favor "
"of the ``Guid`` field, described below."

"**Age** - The number of times the PDB file has been written.  This can be "
"used along with ``Guid`` to match the PDB to its corresponding executable."

msgid ""
"**Guid** - A 128-bit identifier guaranteed to be unique across space and "
"time. In general, this can be thought of as the result of calling the Win32 "
"API `UuidCreate <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/"
"aa379205(v=vs.85).aspx>`__, although LLVM cannot rely on that, as it must "
"work on non-Windows platforms."

"The linker is responsible for writing both the PDB and the final executable, "
"and as a result is the only entity capable of writing the information "
"necessary to match the PDB to the executable."

"In order to accomplish this, the linker generates a guid for the PDB (or re-"
"uses the existing guid if it is linking incrementally) and increments the "
"Age field."

msgid ""
"The executable is a PE/COFF file, and part of a PE/COFF file is the presence "
"of number of \"directories\".  For our purposes here, we are interested in "
"the \"debug directory\".  The exact format of a debug directory is described "
"by the `IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY structure <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/"
"library/windows/desktop/ms680307(v=vs.85).aspx>`__. For this particular "
"case, the linker emits a debug directory of type "
"``IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_CODEVIEW``.  The format of this record is defined in "
"``llvm/DebugInfo/CodeView/CVDebugRecord.h``, but it suffices to say here "
"only that it includes the same ``Guid`` and ``Age`` fields.  At runtime, a "
"debugger or tool can scan the COFF executable image for the presence of a "
"debug directory of the correct type and verify that the Guid and Age match."
