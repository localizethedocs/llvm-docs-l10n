"The LLVM Qualification Group is an open working group within the LLVM "
"community. It was created to coordinate efforts around enabling the use of "
"LLVM components in safety-critical applications such as those governed by "
"ISO 26262 (automotive), DO-178C (aerospace), and EN 50128 (railways)."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:16
msgid ""
"LLVM is increasingly used in safety-critical domains (e.g., automotive, "
"aerospace, medical), but currently lacks a shared structure to address the "
"specific needs of functional safety, such as systematic assurance arguments, "
"tool qualification artifacts, and their associated documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:21
msgid ""
"A more open, upstream, reusable, and collaborative approach would benefit "
"the wider ecosystem. This group serves as a public forum for those "
"interested in improving LLVMâ€™s suitability for use in such environments."
