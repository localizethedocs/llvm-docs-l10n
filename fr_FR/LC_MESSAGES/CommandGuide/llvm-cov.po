"The :program:`llvm-cov` tool shows code coverage information for programs "

"The :program:`llvm-cov gcov` tool reads code coverage data files and "
"displays the coverage information for a specified source file. It is "
"compatible with the ``gcov`` tool from version 4.2 of ``GCC`` and may also "
"be compatible with some later versions of ``gcov``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-cov.rst:49
msgid ""
"To use :program:`llvm-cov gcov`, you must first build an instrumented "
"version of your application that collects coverage data as it runs. Compile "
"with the ``-fprofile-arcs`` and ``-ftest-coverage`` options to add the "
"instrumentation. (Alternatively, you can use the ``--coverage`` option, "
"which includes both of those other options.) You should compile with "
"debugging information (``-g``) and without optimization (``-O0``); "
"otherwise, the coverage data cannot be accurately mapped back to the source "
"code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-cov.rst:57
msgid ""
"At the time you compile the instrumented code, a ``.gcno`` data file will be "
"generated for each object file. These ``.gcno`` files contain half of the "
"coverage data. The other half of the data comes from ``.gcda`` files that "
"are generated when you run the instrumented program, with a separate ``."
"gcda`` file for each object file. Each time you run the program, the "
"execution counts are summed into any existing ``.gcda`` files, so be sure to "
"remove any old files if you do not want their contents to be included."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-cov.rst:65
msgid ""
"By default, the ``.gcda`` files are written into the same directory as the "
"object files, but you can override that by setting the ``GCOV_PREFIX`` and "
"``GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP`` environment variables. The ``GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP`` "
"variable specifies a number of directory components to be removed from the "
"start of the absolute path to the object file directory. After stripping "
"those directories, the prefix from the ``GCOV_PREFIX`` variable is added. "
"These environment variables allow you to run the instrumented program on a "
"machine where the original object file directories are not accessible, but "
"you will then need to copy the ``.gcda`` files back to the object file "
"directories where :program:`llvm-cov gcov` expects to find them."

msgid ""
"Once you have generated the coverage data files, run :program:`llvm-cov "
"gcov` for each main source file where you want to examine the coverage "
"results. This should be run from the same directory where you previously ran "
"the compiler. The results for the specified source file are written to a "
"file named by appending a ``.gcov`` suffix. A separate output file is also "
"created for each file included by the main source file, also with a ``."
"gcov`` suffix added."

"displayed as ``#####``."
