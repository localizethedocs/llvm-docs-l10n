msgid ""
"The :program:`llvm-reduce` tool project that can be used for reducing the "
"size of LLVM test cases. It works by removing redundant or unnecessary code "
"from LLVM test cases while still preserving their ability to detect bugs."

"If ``input`` is \"``-``\", :program:`llvm-reduce` reads from standard input. "

"LLVM-Reduce is a useful tool for reducing the size and complexity of LLVM "

"Note : Granularity refers to the level of detail at which the reduction "
