"TableGen backends are at the core of TableGen's functionality. The source "
"files provide the semantics to a generated (in memory) structure, but it's "
"up to the backend to print this out in a way that is meaningful to the user "
"(normally a C program including a file or a textual list of warnings, "
"options and error messages)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../TableGen/BackEnds.rst:17
msgid ""
"TableGen is used by both LLVM and Clang with very different goals. LLVM uses "
"it as a way to automate the generation of massive amounts of information "
"regarding instructions, schedules, cores and architecture features. Some "
"backends generate output that is consumed by more than one source file, so "
"they need to be created in a way that is easy to use pre-processor tricks. "
"Some backends can also print C code structures, so that they can be directly "
"included as-is."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../TableGen/BackEnds.rst:24
msgid ""
"Clang, on the other hand, uses it mainly for diagnostic messages (errors, "
"warnings, tips) and attributes, so more on the textual end of the scale."

"This document is raw. Each section below needs three sub-sections: "
"description of its purpose with a list of users, output generated from "
"generic input, and finally why it needed a new backend (in case there's "
"something similar)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../TableGen/BackEnds.rst:35
msgid ""
"Overall, each backend will take the same TableGen file type and transform "
"into similar output for different targets/uses. There is an implicit "
"contract between the TableGen files, the back-ends and their users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../TableGen/BackEnds.rst:39
msgid ""
"For instance, a global contract is that each back-end produces macro-guarded "
"sections. Based on whether the file is included by a header or a source "
"file, or even in which context of each file the include is being used, you "
"have todefine a macro just before including it, to get the right output:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../TableGen/BackEnds.rst:49
msgid ""
"And just part of the generated file would be included. This is useful if you "
"need the same information in multiple formats (instantiation, "
"initialization, getter/setter functions, etc) from the same source TableGen "
"file without having to re-compile the TableGen file multiple times."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../TableGen/BackEnds.rst:54

"Sometimes, multiple macros might be defined before the same include file to "
"output multiple blocks:"

"The macros will be undef'd automatically as they're used, in the include "

msgid ""
"On all LLVM back-ends, the ``llvm-tblgen`` binary will be executed on the "
"root TableGen file ``<Target>.td``, which should include all others. This "
"guarantees that all information needed is accessible, and that no "
"duplication is needed in the TableGen files."
