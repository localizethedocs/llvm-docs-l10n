":program:`llvm-symbolizer` reads object file names and addresses from the "
"command-line and prints corresponding source code locations to standard "
"output."

msgid ""
"If no address is specified on the command-line, it reads the addresses from "
"standard input. If no object file is specified on the command-line, but "
"addresses are, or if at any time an input value is not recognized, the input "
"is simply echoed to the output."

"A positional argument or standard input value can be preceded by \"DATA\" or "
"\"CODE\" to indicate that the address should be symbolized as data or "
"executable code respectively. If neither is specified, \"CODE\" is assumed. "
"DATA is symbolized as address and symbol size rather than line number."

":program:`llvm-symbolizer` parses options from the environment variable "
