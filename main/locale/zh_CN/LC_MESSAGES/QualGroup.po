"The LLVM Qualification Group is an open working group within the LLVM "
"community. It was created to coordinate efforts around enabling the use of "
"LLVM components in safety-critical applications governed by functional "
"safety standards such as IEC 61508 (for general E/E/PE systems), IEC 62304 "
"(medical devices), ISO 26262 (automotive), DO-178C (aerospace), and EN 50716 "
"(railways)."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:22
msgid ""
"LLVM is increasingly used in safety-critical domains (e.g., automotive, "
"aerospace, medical), but currently lacks a shared structure to address the "
"specific needs of functional safety, such as systematic assurance arguments, "
"tool qualification artifacts, and their associated documentation."

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:27
msgid ""
"A more open, upstream, reusable, and collaborative approach would benefit "
"the wider ecosystem. This group serves as a public forum for those "
"interested in improving LLVM’s suitability for use in such environments."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:135
msgid ""
"We understand that most members contribute in a limited capacity due to "
"their primary responsibilities. This initiative is volunteer-driven, and we "
"operate with the following shared principles:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:137
msgid ""
"**Acknowledgement of limited bandwidth:** We recognize that no one is "
"working full-time on this group, and participation will vary based on "
"individual availability and priorities."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:138
msgid ""
"**Small and consistent contributions are valuable:** We believe that steady "
"ongoing contributions, even if minimal, are crucial for long-term success, "
"as long as there is coordination and respect for each other's time. Even "
"small contributions (e.g., a few hours per month) can significantly advance "
"the group's goals and have an impact."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:139
msgid ""
"**Realistic progress expectations:** Given the voluntary nature and no full-"
"time involvement, we expect our progress to be slow. This group was "
"initiated in July 2025. Concrete outcomes in 1-2 years would be considered "
"excellent for this type of cross-company and voluntary collaboration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:140
msgid ""
"**Respect for differing capacities:** We value every member’s engagement, "
"whether large or small, often or sporadically, as it all contributes to the "
"overall effort. Even contributions that may seem small, such as sharing an "
"idea or pointing out a relevant resource, are meaningful and important."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../QualGroup.rst:142
msgid ""
"However, we need a balance between flexibility, structure, and enough "
"organization to move forward together. Members are expected to remain "
"engaged through one or more of the following:"

msgid "Regular participation in meetings or asynchronous discussions."
