"This document deals with the legacy pass manager. LLVM uses the new pass "

"The LLVM Pass Framework is an important part of the LLVM system, because "
"LLVM passes are where most of the interesting parts of the compiler exist.  "
"Passes perform the transformations and optimizations that make up the "
"compiler, they build the analysis results that are used by these "
"transformations, and they are, above all, a structuring technique for "
"compiler code."

"All LLVM passes are subclasses of the `Pass <https://llvm.org/doxygen/"

"virtual methods inherited from ``Pass``.  Depending on how your pass works, "
"you should inherit from the :ref:`ModulePass <writing-an-llvm-pass-"
"ModulePass>` , :ref:`CallGraphSCCPass <writing-an-llvm-pass-"
