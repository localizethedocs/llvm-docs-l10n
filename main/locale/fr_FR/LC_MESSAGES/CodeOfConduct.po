"The LLVM community has always worked to be a welcoming and respectful "

"To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to:"

"This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it "
"in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to "

"This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the LLVM project or "
"The LLVM Foundation. This includes Discord channels, mailing lists, bug "
"trackers, LLVM events such as the developer meetings and socials, and any "
"other forums created by the project that the community uses for "
"communication. It applies to all of your communication and conduct in these "
"spaces, including emails, chats, things you say, slides, videos, posters, "
"signs, or even t-shirts you display in these spaces."

"In rare cases, violations of this code outside of these spaces may affect a "
"person’s ability to participate within these spaces. Important examples "
"include `sexual and gender-based violence`_, `hate crimes`_, and `hate "
"speech`_. We do not conduct proactive research, but we have an obligation to "
"respond to any reported concerns. We are not interested in evaluating "
"severity, responding punitively, or holding people accountable. Both the "
"relevance and our response is instead focused on how a person’s continued "
"participation impacts the community’s safety, wellbeing, and inclusivity. We "
"specifically prioritize remaining a welcoming community to victims as well "
"as groups subjected to systemic marginalization or underrepresentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CodeOfConduct.rst:45

"In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may, in rare "

"conduct amounts to an egregious violation of this code."

"sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family "

"**Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn "
"will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users "
"and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. "
"Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be "
"communicating in someone else's primary language."

"**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement "
"is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience "
"some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn "
"into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where "
"people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of "
"the LLVM community should be respectful when dealing with other members as "
"well as with people outside the LLVM community."

"**When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and "
"technical, happen all the time and LLVM is no exception. It is important "
"that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember "
"that we're different. The strength of LLVM comes from its varied community, "
"people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different "
"perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a "
"viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to "
"err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on "
"helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes."
