"The regression test structure is very simple but does require some "

"In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must have "

"adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from another "

"``RUN`` lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the "

"a shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable "
"substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell "
"script, they are not. ``RUN`` lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`. "
"Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify "
"as many ``RUN`` lines as needed."

msgid ""
":program:`lit` performs substitution on each ``RUN`` line to replace LLVM "

"any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../TestingGuide.rst:245
msgid ""
"Each ``RUN`` line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless "
"its last character is ``\\``. This continuation character causes the ``RUN`` "
"line to be concatenated with the next one. In this way, you can build up "
"long pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines "
"ending in ``\\`` are concatenated until a ``RUN`` line that doesn't end in "
"``\\`` is found. This concatenated set of ``RUN`` lines then constitutes one "
"execution. :program:`lit` will substitute variables and arrange for the "
"pipeline to be executed. If any process in the pipeline fails, the entire "
"line (and test case) fails too."

"In general, you should strive to keep your ``RUN`` lines as simple as "
