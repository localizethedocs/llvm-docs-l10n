"This LLVM IR pass reports various statistics for codes compiled for GPUs.  "
"The goal of these statistics is to help identify bad code patterns and ways "
"to mitigate them.  The pass operates at the LLVM IR level so that it can, in "
"theory, support any LLVM-based compiler for programming languages supporting "
"GPUs."

"By default, the pass runs at the end of LTO, and options like ``-"
"Rpass=kernel-info`` enable its remarks.  Example ``opt`` and ``clang`` "
"command lines appear in the next section."

"Remarks include summary statistics (e.g., total size of static allocas) and "
"individual occurrences (e.g., source location of each alloca).  Examples of "
"the output appear in tests in `llvm/test/Analysis/KernelInfo`."

"When specifying an LLVM pass pipeline on the command line, ``kernel-info`` "
"still runs at the end of LTO by default.  ``-no-kernel-info-end-lto`` "
"disables that behavior so you can position ``kernel-info`` explicitly:"
