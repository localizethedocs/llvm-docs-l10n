"In DWARF 5, expressions are evaluated using a typed value stack, a separate "
"location area, and an independent loclist mechanism. This extension unifies "
"all three mechanisms into a single generalized DWARF expression evaluation "
"model that allows both typed values and location descriptions to be "
"manipulated on the evaluation stack. Both single and multiple location "
"descriptions are supported on the stack. In addition, the call frame "
"information (CFI) is extended to support the full generality of location "
"descriptions. This is done in a manner that is backwards compatible with "
"DWARF 5. The extension involves changes to the DWARF 5 sections 2.5 (pp "
"26-38), 2.6 (pp 38-45), and 6.4 (pp 171-182)."

"Other approaches were explored that involved adding specialized operations "
