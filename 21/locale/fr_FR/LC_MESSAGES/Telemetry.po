msgid ""
"Provides a common framework in LLVM for collecting various usage and "
"performance metrics. It is located at ``llvm/Telemetry/Telemetry.h``."

msgid "Characteristics"

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:20
msgid "Configurable and extensible by:"

msgid ""
"Tools: any tool that wants to use Telemetry can extend and customize it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:23
msgid ""
"Vendors: Toolchain vendors can also provide custom implementation of the "
"library, which could either override or extend the given tool's upstream "
"implementation, to best fit their organization's usage and privacy models."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:26
msgid ""
"End users of such tool can also configure Telemetry (as allowed by their "
"vendor)."

msgid "Important notes"

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:32
msgid ""
"There is no concrete implementation of a Telemetry library in upstream LLVM. "
"We only provide the abstract API here. Any tool that wants telemetry will "
"implement one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:36
msgid ""
"The rationale for this is that all the tools in LLVM are very different in "
"what they care about (what/where/when to instrument data). Hence, it might "
"not be practical to have a single implementation. However, in the future, if "
"we see enough common pattern, we can extract them into a shared place. This "
"is TBD - contributions are welcome."

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:42
msgid ""
"No implementation of Telemetry in upstream LLVM shall store any of the "
"collected data due to privacy and security reasons:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:45
msgid "Different organizations have different privacy models:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:47
msgid "Which data is sensitive, which is not?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:48
msgid ""
"Whether it is acceptable for instrumented data to be stored anywhere? (to a "
"local file, what not?)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:51
msgid ""
"Data ownership and data collection consents are hard to accommodate from "
"LLVM developers' point of view:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:54
msgid ""
"E.g., data collected by Telemetry is not necessarily owned by the user of an "
"LLVM tool with Telemetry enabled, hence the user's consent to data "
"collection is not meaningful. On the other hand, LLVM developers have no "
"reasonable ways to request consent from the \"real\" owners."

msgid "Key components"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:66
msgid "The framework consists of four important classes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:68
msgid ""
"``llvm::telemetry::Manager``: The class responsible for collecting and "
"transmitting telemetry data. This is the main point of interaction between "
"the framework and any tool that wants to enable telemetry."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:71
msgid "``llvm::telemetry::TelemetryInfo``: Data courier"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:72
msgid ""
"``llvm::telemetry::Destination``: Data sink to which the Telemetry framework "
"sends data. Its implementation is transparent to the framework. It is up to "
"the vendor to decide which pieces of data to forward and where to forward "
"them to for their final storage."
msgstr ""

msgid "``llvm::telemetry::Config``: Configurations for the ``Manager``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:82
msgid "How to implement and interact with the API"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:84
msgid ""
"To use Telemetry in your tool, you need to provide a concrete implementation "
"of the ``Manager`` class and ``Destination``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Telemetry.rst:86
msgid ""
"Define a custom ``Serializer``, ``Manager``, ``Destination`` and optionally "
"a subclass of ``TelemetryInfo``"
