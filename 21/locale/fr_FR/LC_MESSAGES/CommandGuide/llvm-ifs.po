msgid ""
":program:`llvm-ifs` is a tool that jointly produces human readable text-"
"based stubs (.ifs files) for shared objects and linkable shared object stubs "
"(.so files) from either ELF shared objects or text-based stubs. The text-"
"based stubs is useful for monitoring ABI changes of the shared object. The "
"linkable shared object stubs can be used to avoid unnecessary relinks when "
"the ABI of shared libraries does not change."
