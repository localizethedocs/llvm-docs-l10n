msgid ""
"There are many LLVM forks that exist, and we currently default to preventing "
"actions from running outside of the LLVM organization to prevent them from "
"running in forks. We default to this as actions running in forks are usually "
"not desired and only run by accident. In addition, many of our workflows "
"assume that they are operating within the main LLVM repository and break "
"otherwise."

"Adhering to this best practice looks like adding the following to each of "
"the jobs specified within a workflow:"

"We choose to use ``github.repository_owner`` rather than ``github."
"repository`` to enable these workflows to run in forks inside the LLVM "
"organization such as the ClangIR fork."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CIBestPractices.rst:41
msgid ""
"There are some exceptions to this rule where ``github.repository`` might be "
"used when it makes sense to limit a workflow to only running in the main "
"monorepo repository. These include things like the issue subscriber and "
"release tasks, which should not run anywhere else."

"Github Actions allows the use of actions from other repositories as steps in "
"jobs. We take advantage of various actions for a variety of different tasks, "
"but especially tasks like checking out the repository, and downloading/"
"uploading build caches. These actions are typically versioned with just a "
"release, which looks like the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CIBestPractices.rst:61
msgid ""
"However, it is best practice to specify an exact commit SHA from which to "
"pull the action from, noting the version in a comment:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CIBestPractices.rst:64

"We plan on revisiting this recommendation once Github's immutable actions "
"have been rolled out as GA."

#: ../../../CIBestPractices.rst:73
msgid ""
"This is beneficial for two reasons: reliability and security. Specifying an "
"exact SHA rather than just a major version ensures we end up running the "
"same action originally specified when the workflow as authored and/or "
"updated, and that no breaking changes sneak in from new versions of a "
"workflow being released. However, this effect could also be achieved by "
"specifying an exact dot release. The biggest reason to prefer hash pinned "
"dependencies is security. Release assets on Github are mutable, allowing an "
"attacker to change the code within a specific version of an action after the "
"fact, potentially stealing sensitive tokens and credentials. Hash pinning "
"the dependencies prevents this as the hash would change with the code."

#: ../../../CIBestPractices.rst:87
msgid ""
"Github actions allows the use of either specifically versioned runner images "
"(e.g., ``ubuntu-22.04``), or just the latest runner image (e.g., ``ubuntu-"
"latest``). It is best practice to use explicitly versioned runner images. "
"This prevents breakages when Github rolls the latest runner image to a new "
"version with potentially breaking changes, instead allowing us to explicitly "
"opt-in to using the new image when we have done sufficient testing to ensure "
"that our existing workflows work as expected in the new environment."

"If specific jobs within the workflow need additional permissions, those "
"permissions should be added within the specific job. This practice locks "
"down all permissions by default and only enables them when needed, better "
"enforcing the principle of least privilege."
