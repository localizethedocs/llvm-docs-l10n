msgstr ""

#: ../../../CodeReview.rst:30
msgid ""
"Code can be reviewed either before it is committed or after. We expect "
"significant patches to be reviewed before being committed. Smaller patches "
"(or patches where the developer owns the component) that meet likely-"
"community-consensus requirements (as apply to all patch approvals) can be "
"committed prior to an explicit review. In situations where there is any "
"uncertainty, a patch should be reviewed prior to being committed."

"Please note that the developer responsible for a patch is also responsible "
"for making all necessary review-related changes, including those requested "
"during any post-commit review."

msgid "Can Code Be Reviewed After It Is Committed?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CodeReview.rst:46
msgid ""
"Post-commit review is encouraged, and can be accomplished using any of the "
"tools detailed below. There is a strong expectation that authors respond "
"promptly to post-commit feedback and address it. Failure to do so is cause "
"for the patch to be :ref:`reverted <revert_policy>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CodeReview.rst:51
msgid ""
"If a community member expresses a concern about a recent commit, and this "
"concern would have been significant enough to warrant a conversation during "
"pre-commit review (including around the need for more design discussions), "
"they may ask for a revert to the original author who is responsible to "
"revert the patch promptly. Developers often disagree, and erring on the side "
"of the developer asking for more review prevents any lingering disagreement "
"over code in the tree. This does not indicate any fault from the patch "
"author, this is inherent to our post-commit review practices. Reverting a "
"patch ensures that design discussions can happen without blocking other "
"development; it's entirely possible the patch will end up being reapplied "
"essentially as-is once concerns have been resolved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CodeReview.rst:63
msgid ""
"Before being recommitted, the patch generally should undergo further review. "
"The community member who identified the problem is expected to engage "
"actively in the review. In cases where the problem is identified by a "
"buildbot, a community member with access to hardware similar to that on the "
"buildbot is expected to engage in the review."

msgid ""
"Please note: The bar for post-commit feedback is not higher than for pre-"
"commit feedback. Don't delay unnecessarily in providing feedback. However, "
"if you see something after code has been committed about which you would "
"have commented pre-commit (had you noticed it earlier), please feel free to "
"provide that feedback at any time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CodeReview.rst:75
msgid ""
"That having been said, if a substantial period of time has passed since the "
"original change was committed, it may be better to create a new patch to "
"address the issues than comment on the original commit. The original patch "

msgid ""
"Some changes are too significant for just a code review. Changes that should "
"change the LLVM Language Reference (e.g., adding new target-independent "
"intrinsics), adding language extensions in Clang, and so on, require an RFC "
"(Request for Comment) topic on the `LLVM Discussion Forums <https://"
"discourse.llvm.org>`_ first. For changes that promise significant impact on "
"users and/or downstream code bases, reviewers can request an RFC achieving "
"consensus before proceeding with code review. That having been said, posting "

"Code review can be an iterative process, which continues until the patch is "

"All comments by reviewers should be acknowledged by the patch author. It is "
"generally expected that suggested changes will be incorporated into a future "
"revision of the patch unless the author and/or other reviewers can "
"articulate a good reason to do otherwise (and then the reviewers must "
"agree). If a new patch does not address all outstanding feedback, the author "
"should explicitly state that when providing the updated patch. When using "

"Aim to limit the number of iterations in the review process. For example, "
"when suggesting a change, if you want the author to make a similar set of "

"will require multiple steps prior to approval (e.g., splitting, refactoring, "

"these up front as possible. This allows the patch author and reviewers to "

"When providing an unqualified LGTM (approval to commit), it is the "
"responsibility of the reviewer to have reviewed all of the prior discussion "
"and feedback from all reviewers ensuring that all feedback has been "
"addressed and that all other reviewers will almost surely be satisfied with "
"the patch being approved. If unsure, the reviewer should provide a qualified "
"approval, (e.g., \"LGTM, but please wait for @someone, @someone_else\"). You "
"may also do this if you are fairly certain that a particular community "
"member will wish to review, even if that person hasn't done so yet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CodeReview.rst:167
msgid ""
"If additional feedback is provided after acceptance (by the same reviewer or "
"another), the author should use their best judgement in deciding whether "
"that feedback can be incorporated into the change without comment (say a "
"typo) or requires further review discussion. More substantial comments (e."
"g., about the design) will usually require further discussion. If unsure, "
"ask the reviewer."

#: ../../../CodeReview.rst:173
msgid ""
"Note that, if a reviewer has requested a particular community member to "
"review, and after a week that community member has yet to respond, feel free "

"further suggestions."

#: ../../../CodeReview.rst:179
msgid ""
"If it is likely that others will want to review a recently-posted patch, "
"especially if there might be objections, but no one else has done so yet, it "
"is also polite to provide a qualified approval (e.g., \"LGTM, but please "
"wait for a couple of days in case others wish to review\"). If approval is "
"received very quickly, a patch author may also elect to wait before "
"committing (and this is certainly considered polite for non-trivial "
"patches). Especially given the global nature of our community, this waiting "
"time should be at least 24 hours. Please also be mindful of weekends and "
"major holidays."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CodeReview.rst:188
msgid ""
"Our goal is to ensure community consensus around design decisions and "
"significant implementation choices, and one responsibility of a reviewer, "
"when providing an overall approval for a patch, is to be reasonably sure "
"that such consensus exists. If you're not familiar enough with the community "
"to know, then you shouldn't be providing final approval to commit. A "
"reviewer providing final approval should have commit access to the LLVM "
