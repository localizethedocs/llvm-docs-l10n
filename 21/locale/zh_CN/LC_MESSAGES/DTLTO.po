"Distributed ThinLTO (DTLTO) enables the distribution of backend ThinLTO "
"compilations via external distribution systems, such as Incredibuild, during "
"the link step."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../DTLTO.rst:18

"DTLTO extends the existing ThinLTO distribution support which uses separate "
"*thin-link*, *backend compilation*, and *link* steps. This method is "
"documented here:"

"Using the *separate thin-link* approach requires a build system capable of "
"handling the dynamic dependencies specified in the individual summary index "
"files, such as Bazel. DTLTO removes this requirement, allowing it to be used "
"with any build process that supports in-process ThinLTO."

"This information is supplied, via a JSON file, to ``distributor_process``, "
