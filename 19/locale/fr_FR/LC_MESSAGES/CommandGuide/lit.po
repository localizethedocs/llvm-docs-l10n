msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:14
msgid ""
":program:`lit` is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test "
"suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures. :"
"program:`lit` is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a "
"user interface as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:19
msgid ""
":program:`lit` should be run with one or more *tests* to run specified on "
"the command line.  Tests can be either individual test files or directories "
"to search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:23
msgid ""
"Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all "
"tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the "
"number of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`).  "
"The :program:`lit` program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any "
"tests fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:29
msgid ""
"By default :program:`lit` will use a succinct progress display and will only "
"print summary information for test failures.  See :ref:`output-options` for "
"options controlling the :program:`lit` progress display and output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:33
msgid ""
":program:`lit` also includes a number of options for controlling how tests "
"are executed (specific features may depend on the particular test format).  "
"See :ref:`execution-options` for more information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:37
msgid ""
"Finally, :program:`lit` also supports additional options for only running a "
"subset of the options specified on the command line, see :ref:`selection-"
"options` for more information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:41
msgid ""
":program:`lit` parses options from the environment variable ``LIT_OPTS`` "
"after parsing options from the command line.  ``LIT_OPTS`` is primarily "
"useful for supplementing or overriding the command-line options supplied to :"
"program:`lit` by ``check`` targets defined by a project's build system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:46
msgid ""
":program:`lit` can also read options from response files which are specified "
"as inputs using the ``@path/to/file.rsp`` syntax. Arguments read from a file "
"must be one per line and are treated as if they were in the same place as "
"the original file referencing argument on the command line. A response file "
"can reference other response files."
