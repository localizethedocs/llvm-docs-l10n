msgid ""
":program:`llvm-locstats` works like a wrapper around :program:`llvm-"
"dwarfdump`. It parses :program:`llvm-dwarfdump` statistics regarding debug "
"location by pretty printing it in a more human readable way."

"The line 0% shows the number and the percentage of DIEs with no location "
"information, but the line 100% shows the information for DIEs where there is "
"location information in all code section bytes (where the variable or "
"parameter is in the scope). The line [50%,60%) shows the number and the "
"percentage of DIEs where the location information is between 50 and 60 "
"percentage of its scope covered."
