msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-diff.rst:14
msgid ""
"**llvm-diff** compares the structure of two LLVM modules, primarily focusing "
"on differences in function definitions.  Insignificant differences, such as "
"changes in the ordering of globals or in the names of local values, are "
"ignored."

"An input module will be interpreted as an assembly file if its name ends in "
"'.ll';  otherwise it will be read in as a bitcode file."

msgid ""
"If a list of global names is given, just the values with those names are "
"compared; otherwise, all global values are compared, and diagnostics are "
"produced for globals which only appear in one module or the other."

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-diff.rst:27
msgid ""
"**llvm-diff** compares two functions by comparing their basic blocks, "
"beginning with the entry blocks.  If the terminators seem to match, then the "
"corresponding successors are compared; otherwise they are ignored.  This "
"algorithm is very sensitive to changes in control flow, which tend to stop "
"any downstream changes from being detected."

"**llvm-diff** is intended as a debugging tool for writers of LLVM passes and "
"frontends.  It does not have a stable output format."

msgid "EXIT STATUS"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-diff.rst:39
msgid ""
"If **llvm-diff** finds no differences between the modules, it will exit with "
"0 and produce no output.  Otherwise it will exit with a non-zero value."

"Changes in memory behavior (for example, coalescing loads) can cause massive "
