msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CommandGuide/llvm-bcanalyzer.rst:14
msgid ""
"The :program:`llvm-bcanalyzer` command is a small utility for analyzing "
"bitcode files.  The tool reads a bitcode file (such as generated with the :"
"program:`llvm-as` tool) and produces a statistical report on the contents of "
"the bitcode file.  The tool can also dump a low level but human readable "
"version of the bitcode file.  This tool is probably not of much interest or "
"utility except for those working directly with the bitcode file format.  "
"Most LLVM users can just ignore this tool."

"If *filename* is omitted or is ``-``, then :program:`llvm-bcanalyzer` reads "
